You're right, the previous solution has some room for optimization and clarity! 

Here's a refined version that addresses the points raised:

**Improved Code**

```python
def find_max_k(n):
  """
  Finds the maximum value of 'k' such that:
  n & (n-1) & (n-2) & (n-3) ... & k = 0

  Args:
    n: An integer

  Returns:
    The maximum value of 'k'
  """
  k = 0  
  while (n & (n - k)) > 0:
    k += 1

  return k
  

t =  int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  n = int(input()) 
  print(find_max_k(n))
```


**Explanations and Refinements:**

1. **Direct 'while' Loop:**  The logic for calculating `k` improved the efficiency of finding the correct solution, instead of a nested loop. 
2. **Clearer Input and Output:** The code is structured for better readability.  Formatting the output is aligned with the output specification. 
 
**How This Approach Works**

* **Bitwise AND:**  The key is finding the number 'k' that makes the bitwise AND calculation result in zero. 

Feel free to ask if you need more detailed explanations of any specific piece of it.  Let me know if you'd like further clarifications about any part! <end_of_turn>
