<start_of_turn>model
You're right! The previous solution is overly simplistic.  The input does have a specific requirement â€“ we need to check the price of various amounts to minimize the number of shovels bought.  

Here's a more robust Python code solution that incorporates the input requirements and includes a clear explanation. 


```python
def minShovels(k, r):
    """
    Finds the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy for a given price/coin
    """

    minShovels = float('inf')

    for i in range(1, (k // r) + 1):  # Try buying from 1 to 'k / r' shovels.
        shovels = i
        total = shovels * k
        if (total <= r) and (total-r) % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Minimum shovels purchased: {shovels}")
        else:
            print(f"Minimum shovels purchased: {shovels}") 

    return minShovels

# Example usage
k = 117 
r = 3
minShovels(k, r)

# Example Usage to ensure it works!
input_k, input_r = map(int, input().split())
min_shovels = minShovels(input_k, input_r)
print(min_shovels)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initializes Input:** It takes input for `k` (price of the shovel) and `r` (coin denomination), making it suitable for input from a user.
2. **The Loop:** The `for` loop iterates using a `for i in range(1, (k // r) + 1):` loop to test up to the calculated amount of shovels he could buy using `i` and the price of each shovel 


. 
 

**Key improvements:**
* **Iterative approach:** More efficient for a set number of shovels purchased from the code provided.
