You're right, the initial code was a bit convoluted and had some logical errors. Here's a refined version focusing on clearer instructions and better accuracy: 

```python
def maxStones(t):
    """
    Calculates the maximum number of stones Alice can collect.
   
    Args:
        t: the number of test cases.

    Returns:
        A list of integers representing the maximum number of stones for each test case.
    """
    result = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split()) 
        total_stones = 0
        
        if b >= 2 and a >= 1:
            while b >= 2 and a >= 1:
                total_stones += 4
                b -= 2
                a -= 1

        if b >= 1 and c >= 2:
            while b >= 1 and c >= 2 :
                total_stones += 4
                b -= 1
                c -= 2
                
        result.append(total_stones)
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    tests = int(input()) 

    number_of_cases = maxStones(tests)

for s in number_of_cases:
    print(s) 
```



**Explanation of improvements:**

1. **Direct Interpretation:** The code now directly reads input without unnecessary variable creation and makes use of the input more closely matches the input specification in the prompt.
2. **Efficient Algorithm:** The logic is streamlined to follow a simple, clear method of calculating stone collection in each test case, which is efficient for analyzing the number of operations.
3. **Clarity:**  The code is formatted for better readability, using white space and consistent indentation for better readability and logic.
4. **Error Handling:** In this enhanced version, no error handling is included, and there are no error messages or handling in place, such as a condition or else statement.

Let me know if you have any more questions or would like me to go deeper into optimization! Let me know if you would like additional test cases or want further analysis of the solution. <end_of_turn>
