You're right! The previous solution contained some errors in handling the output format and was inefficient in exploring the problem. 

Here's a revised solution that addresses those issues:


```python
def find_common_subsequence(a, b):
    n = len(a)
    m = len(b)
    i = 0 
    j = 0
    c = []
    while i < n and j < m:
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            c.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif a[i] < b[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    return c


def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Get array size for a
        m = int(input())  # Get array size for b 
        a = list(map(int, input().split())) 
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        common = find_common_subsequence(a, b)

        if len(common) > 0:
            print("YES")
            print(len(common), *common)
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()

```


**Key Improvements**

1. **Clear Input Handling:** The input is now more explicit, with `int` conversion for clear separation of the array elements:
  - `n`: The size of array `a`.
  - `m`: The size of array `b`.
  - `a`:  The elements of array `a` read from user input using `input()`, separated by spaces, and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`
  - Similarly, `b` is read in the same way.

2. **Output Formatting:** The code now directly generates the output as required:
    - "YES" is output only when a subsequence exists.
    - The length `k` is printed.
    - The elements are printed with spaces as a string.
