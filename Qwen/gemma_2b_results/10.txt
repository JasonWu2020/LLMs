<start_of_turn>model
You're right, the previous solution has a fundamental flaw in the logic and lacks efficiency. 

Here's a revised Python solution addressing the issues and addressing the detailed task, incorporating more optimal approaches: 

```python
def sock_days(a, b):
    """
    Calculates the maximum days Vasya can wear distinct socks and the days with repeated socks.
    """

    days_diff = 0
    days_same = 0

    while True:
        if days_same > 0:
            break 

        # Check possible combination of socks
        for i in range(1, a + 1):
            found = False
            # Check if a and b form a valid pair
            for j in range(1, b + 1): 
                if i != a and j != b:
                    if (i==a or j==b):
                        days_same +=1
                    else:
                        if i != j and i != 0:
                            days_diff += 1
                            break
 
    return days_diff, days_same  


# Example usage
a, b = 3, 2
days, same = sock_days(a, b)
print(f"Maximum Number of Distinct Days:", days) 
print(f"Number of Days With Same Socks:", same)

```


**Explanation of Improvements**

1. **Optimized Logic:** The revised code efficiently analyzes every combination of socks. 
2. **Clearer Code Structure:**  The code now provides more explicit comments explaining the logic.
