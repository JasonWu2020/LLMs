You're absolutely right, the initial solution was missing some clarity in handling the output.  Let's break down a better solution and make adjustments.  

**Critique of the previous solution:**

* **Clarity and Readability** 
    * The code lacked comments explaining each step, making the logic less clear. 
* **Indentation:**  The indentation was not consistent.
* **Lack of Testing:**  It didn't consider edge cases for cases with no balanced substrings.

**Updated Solution with Enhanced Explanation**

```python
def balanced_substring(s, n):
    is_balanced = False
    l = -1
    r = -1

    a_count = 0
    b_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'a':
            l = i
            a_count += 1 
        elif s[i] == 'b':
            r = i
            b_count += 1
   
    if a_count == b_count:
        is_balanced = True
        return l + 1, r + 1
    
    return -1 * -1 

# Function to solve the problem for the given test cases
def main():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        s = input().strip()  
        result = balanced_substring(s, n)
        print(*result)   




```



**Explanation**


1. **Function `balanced_substring(String, String)`:**
   *   **Purpose:** We calculate balanced substrings.
   * **Arguments:**  `s`: The input string, `n`: string length
   

2. **Function `balanced(String, String)`**
   * Takes two parameters:
    *  `s`: The input string.
    *  `n`: The length of the string

3. **Initialization**
   * `is_balanced = False`: This is a boolean to track if a balanced substring was found 
   *  `l` and `r` are initialized to -1


4. **Counting Character Counts** 
    * Iterates over the string "s" to count the number of 'a's and 'b's
5. **Determining the substrings:**
    * Checks if the counts are equal.
   * If balanced,  sets `is_balanced` to True, then returns the starting and ending indexes of the balanced substring.
   
6. **Output:** 


**Addressing the Original Constraints**


* **Input Handling:**  We correctly read input including the number of test cases.

    The updated code reads and processes the input appropriately.
