You are absolutely right!  The previous solution was missing a key concept: considering the order of friends.


Here's an improved version of the code with a clearer reasoning and incorporating the constraints:

```python
def find_min_invitations(n, p):
    invitations = set()
    guests = set()
 
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] not in invitations and p[i] != i:
            invitations.add(i)

    return len(invitations)

t = int(input())  
for _ in range(t): 
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))   # Read input (no need for explicit list for input)
    print(find_min_invitations(n, p))  

```
**Explanation:**

1.  **Understanding the Constraints:** Each input, in a test case, will give you the value of n and an array `p`, representing the order of friends where p[i] gives the best friend of the i-th friend. 
2. We can start by adding all friends who have not been invited, but who are within the `p` list
3. **Sorting is optional, but important:**  The code provides clear steps with explanations to implement that the solution in the order specified by the input.
