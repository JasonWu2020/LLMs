You're right; the provided code doesn't produce the expected output format (the number of moves required to make 'a' divisible by 'b').

Here's a revised solution that addresses these points and follows the input specifications:

```python
def minimum_moves(a, b):
    """Counts the minimum moves to make a divisible by b"""
    if a % b == 0:
        return 0 
    else:
        return int((a - (a % b))//b)


t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int,input().split())
    print(minimum_moves(a, b))
```



**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Output Formatting:** The code now directly outputs the calculated result. 


**How the Solution Works**

```python
def minimum_moves(a, b): 
    if a % b == 0: 
        return 0  # Divisible already

    return int((a - (a % b)) // b)
```

* **Direct Calculation:**  
   - **Efficiency:**  This approach is efficient and straightforward. 
   - **Divisible Check:**  
      * `a % b == 0`: Directly checks for divisibility. 
* **Calculation:**  
     - **Optimized Division:** Calculates the minimum moves by dividing  `a - (a % b)` by `b` but rounds down to an integer using `//`  

This updated solution takes the input values for `a` and `b` and performs the following:

* **Takes the input correctly**
* **Checks to see if the number is divisible.**
