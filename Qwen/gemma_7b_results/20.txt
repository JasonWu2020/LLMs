**Outputted Solution:**
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = bin(n).count('1') - 1
    print(k)
```

**Critique:**
The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case reads the value of $n$, calculates the number of consecutive 1s in the binary representation of $n$, and subtracts 1 from that number to find the maximum value of $k$. However, the code does not handle the case where $n$ is 1. In this case, the maximum value of $k$ is 0, not 1.

**Updated Solution:**
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = bin(n).count('1') - 1
    if n == 1:
        k = 0
    print(k)
```<eos>
