## Critique

This solution does not consider the case where there are multiple participants with the same handle and the participant whose handle is colored red before the contest has increased his rating after the contest.

The solution should be updated to account for the following scenario:

- The participant whose handle is colored red before the contest has increased his rating after the contest, even if there is another participant with the same handle.
- The participant whose handle is colored red before the contest has not increased his rating after the contest.

Here is the updated solution:

```python

n = int(input())
red_list = []
for _ in range(n):
    name, before, after = input().split()
    if int(after) - int(before) > 0 and name not in red_list:
        red_list.append(name)
    else:
        red_list.append(name)
if red_list:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

```<eos>
