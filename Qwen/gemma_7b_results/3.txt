**Critique:**

The code is well-structured, but there are a few areas that could be improved.

**Improvements:**

* **Pre-calculate the maximum number of rooks that can be placed in a row and column:** Instead of calculating the maximum number of rooks that can be placed in a row and column in the loop, it can be calculated once outside the loop to improve efficiency.
* **Use a more concise placement matrix:** The placement matrix `placement` can be a 2D list instead of a 2D array to save memory.
* **Check for illegal moves:** The code does not check if moving a rook to an adjacent cell would result in an illegal move, such as moving a rook to a cell that is already occupied by another rook.

**Updated Solution:**

```python

t = int(input())  # Number of test cases

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())  # Size of the chessboard and number of rooks

    if k > n or k > n**2:
        print(-1)  # No stable arrangement

    else:
        # Pre-calculate maximum number of rooks that can be placed in a row and column
        max_rooks_row = min(n, k)
        max_rooks_col = min(n, k)

        # Create a placement matrix
        placement = [[0] * max_rooks_col for _ in range(max_rooks_row)]
        placement[0][0] = 1

        # Fill the remaining cells
        for r in range(1, max_rooks_row):
            for c in range(max_rooks_col):
                if placement[r-1][c] and placement[r][0] <= max_rooks_col:
                    placement[r][c] = 1

        # Check for illegal moves
        for r in range(len(placement)):
            for c in range(len(placement[0])):
                if placement[r][c] == 1 and placement[r-1][c] and placement[r][c-1] == 1:
                    placement[r][c] = 0

        # Print the arrangement
        for r in range(len(placement)):
            for c in range(len(placement[0])):
                if placement[r][c] == 1:
                    print("R", end=" ")
                else:
                    print(". ", end=" ")
            print()
```

**Time Complexity:**

The code calculates the maximum number of rooks that can be placed in a row and column only once, so the time complexity is O(n**2). The loop iterates over the placement matrix only once, so the time complexity is O(n**2) as well.

**Space Complexity:**

The code uses a 2D list `placement` of size `max_rooks_row` and `max_rooks_col`, so the space complexity is O(n**2).<eos>
