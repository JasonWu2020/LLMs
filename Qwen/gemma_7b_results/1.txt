**Critique:**

The code is missing the part where it calculates the pairs of best friends. The code needs to create a set of tuples of best friends, where each tuple contains two integers. Then, the length of the set is returned as the minimum number of invitations.

**Updated Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    pairs = set(tuple(p) for p in p)
    print(len(pairs))
```<eos>
