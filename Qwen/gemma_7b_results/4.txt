**Critique:**

The solution above is correct, but it can be improved. The code calculates the prefix sum of character counts in $s, which is unnecessary. Instead, we can store the character counts in a dictionary and use that information to determine the number of characters to remove.

**Updated Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()

    # Store character counts in a dictionary
    character_counts = {}
    for i in range(n):
        char = s[i]
        if char not in character_counts:
            character_counts[char] = 0
        character_counts[char] += 1

    # Remove characters until the original string is found
    a = ""
    for i in range(n):
        char = s[i]
        if character_counts[char] > 0:
            a += char
            character_counts[char] -= 1

    # Print the decrypted string
    print(a)
```

**Time Complexity:**

The updated solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the encrypted message. This is because the code iterates over the encrypted message only once.

**Space Complexity:**

The updated solution has a space complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the encrypted message. This is because the code stores the character counts in a dictionary, which has a space complexity of O(n).<eos>
