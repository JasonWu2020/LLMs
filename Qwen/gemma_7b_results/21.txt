**Critique:**
The outputted solution is conceptually correct, but it does not handle the case where there are no coins. In that case, the program will output 0, which is incorrect.

**Updated Solution:**

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if not a:
  print(0)
else:
  distinct_coin_values = set(a)
  print(len(distinct_coin_values))
```<eos>
