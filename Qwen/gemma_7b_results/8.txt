**Critique:**

The outputted solution is well-structured and identifies the key operations to maximize the number of stones. However, there are a few points that could be improved:

- The code calculates the maximum number of stones from each heap separately, but it could be more efficient to calculate the maximum number of stones from both heaps in a single loop.
- The code checks if the conditions for each operation are met before taking the stones, but it could be more concise to use a single condition to check if both operations are feasible.

**Updated solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the maximum number of stones from each heap
    max_stones_from_first_heap = min(a, 2)
    max_stones_from_second_heap = min(b, 2)

    # Calculate the maximum number of stones that can be taken
    max_stones = max_stones_from_first_heap + max_stones_from_second_heap

    # Print the answer
    print(max_stones)
```

**This updated solution calculates the maximum number of stones from both heaps in a single loop and uses a single condition to check if both operations are feasible.**<eos>
