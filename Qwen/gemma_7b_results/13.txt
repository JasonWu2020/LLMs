**Critique:**

The solution is well-structured and easy to understand. It follows the problem statement and correctly calculates the operations needed to reduce the length of the password. However, there is one potential issue: the code does not handle the case where the input array is empty. In this case, it will raise an error.

**Updated Solution:**

```python
t = int(input("Number of test cases: "))

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input("Length of the password: "))
    a = list(map(int, input("Enter the password: ").split()))

    if not a:
        print(0)
    else:
        operations = 0
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i] != a[i-1] and a[i] != a[i+1]:
                operations += 1
        print(operations)
```<eos>
