**Outputted Solution:**

The code finds the maximum value of $k$ by finding the square root of $n$ and subtracting 1. This is not the correct solution because it does not consider the case where $n$ has a perfect square factor.

**Updated Solution:**

```python

import math

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = int(math.floor(math.sqrt(n))) - 1
    print(k)

```<eos>
