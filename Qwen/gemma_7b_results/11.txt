**Outputted solution:**

The code finds the greatest divisor of r that is less than or equal to k, but it does not consider the case where r is equal to k. In order to fix this, we need to check if r is equal to k and if it is, then we need to update the minimum number of shovels to 1.

```python
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Find the greatest divisor of r that is less than or equal to k
divisor = int(r) // k * k

# If r is equal to k, then update the minimum number of shovels to 1
if r == k:
    divisor = 1

# Minimum number of shovels to buy
print(divisor)
```

**Updated solution:**

```python
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Find the greatest divisor of r that is less than or equal to k
divisor = int(r) // k * k

# If r is equal to k, then update the minimum number of shovels to 1
if r == k:
    divisor = 1

# Minimum number of shovels to buy
print(divisor)
```<eos>
