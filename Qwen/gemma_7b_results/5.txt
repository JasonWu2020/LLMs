**Critique:**

The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The algorithm is efficient and the time complexity is low. However, the code could be improved by using a more concise method to find the quotient and remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$.

**Updated Solution:**

```python3
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    moves = 0
    if a % b == 0:
        moves = 0
    else:
        moves = (a // b) + 1
    print(moves)
```

**Explanation:**

The updated code uses the integer division operator (`//`) to find the quotient and integer remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. The quotient is then added to the number of moves. If the remainder is not 0, then the number of moves is incremented by 1 until the remainder is 0.<eos>
