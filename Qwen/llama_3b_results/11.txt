The original solution I provided earlier only calculates the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy, but it doesn't take into account the fact that he has an unlimited number of 10-burle coins.

Here's an updated solution that reads the input and prints the solution according to the specifications:

```python
def min_shovels(k, r):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy.

    Args:
        k (int): The price of one shovel.
        r (int): The denomination of the coin different from 10-burle coins.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy.
    """
    # Read the input
    k, r = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the minimum number of shovels
    # We use the ceiling of the division of k by r, and multiply it by the number of 10-burle coins
    # We add 1 to account for the fact that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel
    min_shovels = (k - 1) // r + 1

    return min_shovels

# Read the input and print the solution
k, r = map(int, input().split())
print(min_shovels(k, r))
```

This solution reads the input, calculates the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy, and prints the result according to the specifications. The `//` operator is used for integer division, and the `+ 1` is used to account for the fact that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel.
