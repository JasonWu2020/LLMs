The original solution has a few issues:

1. It doesn't correctly implement the greedy approach. The greedy approach requires us to put the largest coins in the pockets first and try to put as many coins as possible in each pocket without duplicating a coin. The current solution simply increments the minimum number of pockets whenever it encounters a new coin value.

2. It doesn't correctly calculate the minimum number of pockets. The current solution increments the minimum number of pockets for each coin value, which is not correct.

Here's an updated solution that correctly implements the greedy approach and calculates the minimum number of pockets:

```python
def min_pockets(n, coins):
    # Get the number of coins
    num_coins = int(input())
    # Get the coin values
    coin_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each coin value
    coin_count = {}
    
    # Count the occurrence of each coin value
    for coin in coin_values:
        if coin in coin_count:
            coin_count[coin] += 1
        else:
            coin_count[coin] = 1
    
    # Sort the coin values in descending order
    sorted_coins = sorted(coin_count, key=coin_count.get, reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize the minimum number of pockets
    min_pockets = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted coin values
    for coin in sorted_coins:
        # If the count of the current coin is greater than 0
        if coin_count[coin] > 0:
            # Increment the minimum number of pockets
            min_pockets += 1
            # Set the count of the current coin to 0
            coin_count[coin] = 0
    
    # Print the minimum number of pockets
    print(min_pockets)

# Get the number of coins
n = int(input())
# Get the coin values
min_pockets(n, [])
```

However, the above code does not actually call the function with the input values. We need to modify it to do that:

```python
def min_pockets(n, coins):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each coin value
    coin_count = {}
    
    # Count the occurrence of each coin value
    for coin in coins:
        if coin in coin_count:
            coin_count[coin] += 1
        else:
            coin_count[coin] = 1
    
    # Sort the coin values in descending order
    sorted_coins = sorted(coin_count, key=coin_count.get, reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize the minimum number of pockets
    min_pockets = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted coin values
    for coin in sorted_coins:
        # If the count of the current coin is greater than 0
        if coin_count[coin] > 0:
            # Increment the minimum number of pockets
            min_pockets += 1
            # Set the count of the current coin to 0
            coin_count[coin] = 0
    
    # Print the minimum number of pockets
    print(min_pockets)

# Get the number of coins
n = int(input())
# Get the coin values
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))
# Call the function with the input values
min_pockets(n, coins)
```

This updated solution correctly implements the greedy approach and calculates the minimum number of pockets. It reads the input, counts the occurrence of each coin value, sorts the coin values in descending order, and then iterates through the sorted values to calculate the minimum number of pockets. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of coins. The space complexity is O(n) for the dictionary.
