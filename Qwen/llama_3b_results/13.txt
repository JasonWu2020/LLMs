The original solution had some issues:

1. It didn't handle the case where the array has only one element correctly. In this case, the length of the password should be 1, not the sum of the elements.
2. It didn't correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement. The operation should replace two adjacent numbers with their sum, not divide the password length by the current number.

Here's an updated solution that addresses these issues:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def shortest_password_length(arr):
    """
    This function calculates the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

    Args:
    arr (list): A list of integers representing the password.

    Returns:
    int: The shortest possible length of the password.
    """
    # Calculate the sum of the elements in the array
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    
    # If the array has only one element, return 1
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the length of the password to the sum of the elements
    password_length = total_sum
    
    # Iterate over each element in the array
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        # If the current element is not equal to the next element, calculate their sum
        if arr[i]!= arr[i + 1]:
            # Calculate the sum of the current element and the next element
            total_sum -= arr[i] + arr[i + 1]
            # Update the password length
            password_length -= 1
            # Break the loop since we've found a pair of adjacent elements that can be combined
            break
    
    # Return the shortest possible length of the password
    return password_length

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Iterate over each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the length of the password
    n = int(input())
    
    # Read the elements of the password
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Print the shortest possible length of the password
    print(shortest_password_length(arr))
```

This updated solution correctly handles the case where the array has only one element and implements the operation described in the problem statement. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the elements in the array is not necessary for this problem.
