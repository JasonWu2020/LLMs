The original solution has a few issues:

1.  It does not handle the case where the input string ends with a character that has been added to it. In this case, the while loop will not terminate, and the function will return an empty string.
2.  It does not handle the case where the input string starts with a character that has been added to it. In this case, the while loop will not find the character in the string, and the function will return an empty string.
3.  It does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains multiple consecutive characters that have been added to the same character.

Here's an updated solution that addresses these issues:

```python
def decrypt_string(s):
    """
    Decrypts a string that has been encrypted according to the rule: 
    after each character of the original string, an arbitrary number of characters (possibly zero) from the alphabet (excluding the current character) are added, and then the added character is included in the new string.

    Args:
        s (str): The encrypted message.

    Returns:
        str: The decrypted message.
    """
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Find the first occurrence of the current character in the alphabet (excluding the current character) in the remaining part of the string
        j = i + 1
        while j < len(s) and s[j].lower()!= s[i].lower():
            j += 1
        
        # If the character is found, add it to the decrypted message and remove it from the remaining part of the string
        if j < len(s):
            result += s[i]
            i = j
        else:
            # If the character is not found, it means the string has ended without finding a matching character, so we return an empty string
            return ""
    
    return result

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(decrypt_string(s))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this updated solution, I've made the following changes:

1.  Instead of using a while loop that increments `i` by 1 each time, I'm using a for loop that iterates over the indices of the string. This ensures that `i` will never be out of bounds.
2.  I've added a check to make sure that `j` is less than the length of the string before trying to access `s[j]`. This prevents an `IndexError` from occurring when the input string ends with a character that has been added to it.
3.  I've removed the check for the case where the input string starts with a character that has been added to it, as it is not necessary. The for loop will not iterate over the indices of the string if it is empty.
