Here's an updated solution that reads the input and prints the solution according to the specifications:

```python
def min_invitations(n, p):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to the party.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of friends.
        p (list): A list of the best friends for each friend.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of invitations needed.
    """
    # Create a set to store the friends who have a friend who is their own best friend
    own_best_friends = set()
    
    # Iterate over each friend
    for i in range(n):
        # If the friend is their own best friend, add them to the set
        if p[i] == i + 1:
            own_best_friends.add(i + 1)
    
    # Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of invitations needed
    min_invitations_needed = 0
    
    # If there are no friends who are their own best friends
    if not own_best_friends:
        # We need to send invitations to all friends
        min_invitations_needed = n
    else:
        # We can send invitations to the friends who are their own best friends
        min_invitations_needed = len(own_best_friends)
    
    # If there are less than 2 friends who are their own best friends
    if len(own_best_friends) < 2:
        # We need to send invitations to the friends who are not their own best friends
        min_invitations_needed += n - len(own_best_friends)
    
    return min_invitations_needed


# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Read the number of friends and their best friends for each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the number of friends
    n = int(input())
    
    # Read the best friends for each friend
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of invitations needed
    min_invitations = min_invitations(n, p)
    
    # Print the minimum number of invitations needed
    print(min_invitations)
```

This updated solution first checks if there are any friends who are their own best friends. If there are, it calculates the minimum number of invitations needed as the number of these friends. If there are no friends who are their own best friends, it calculates the minimum number of invitations needed as the number of friends. If there are less than 2 friends who are their own best friends, it calculates the minimum number of invitations needed as the number of friends minus the number of friends who are their own best friends, plus the number of friends who are not their own best friends.
