The current solution has a few issues:

1. It doesn't read the input according to the problem's specification, where each test case has two integers on a single line.
2. It doesn't print the solution according to the problem's specification, where each test case's solution should be printed on a separate line.

Here's an updated solution that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys

def min_moves(a, b):
    """
    Returns the minimum number of moves required to make a divisible by b.
    
    Args:
    a (int): The number to be made divisible.
    b (int): The divisor.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of moves required.
    """
    return (a + b - 1) // b

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Process each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the input values
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate and print the result
    result = min_moves(a, b)
    print(result)
```

In this updated solution, I've modified the `min_moves` function to calculate the minimum number of moves required to make `a` divisible by `b` by adding `b-1` to `a` and then dividing the result by `b` using integer division (`//`). This is because we need to make `a` equal to the next multiple of `b`, which is `b-1` more than `a`.

I've also modified the input and output to match the problem's specification, where each test case's input is read on a single line and the result is printed on a separate line.
