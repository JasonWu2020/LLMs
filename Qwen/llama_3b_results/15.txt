The original solution had some issues:

1. It didn't correctly map the colors to their corresponding rating ranges.
2. It didn't correctly check if the rating of a participant increased after the contest.
3. It didn't handle the case where Anton outscored a participant with a handle that was not red before the contest.

Here's an updated solution that addresses these issues:

```python
def solve():
    # Read the number of participants
    n = int(input())

    # Create a dictionary to map colors to their corresponding rating ranges
    color_map = {
        "red": (2400, float('inf')),
        "orange": (2200, 2399),
        "yellow": (2100, 2199),
        "green": (2000, 2099),
        "blue": (1900, 1999),
        "indigo": (1800, 1899),
        "violet": (1700, 1799),
    }

    # Initialize a dictionary to store the handles of participants with red handles
    red_handles = set()

    # Initialize a dictionary to store the ratings of participants
    ratings = {}

    # Read the input data
    for _ in range(n):
        name, before, after = input().split()
        before, after = int(before), int(after)
        ratings[name] = (before, after)

        # Update the ratings of participants
        for color, (lower, upper) in color_map.items():
            if after >= lower and after <= upper:
                if before < lower:
                    red_handles.add(name)

    # Check if Anton outscored a participant with a red handle
    for name, (before, after) in ratings.items():
        if name in red_handles and after > ratings[name][0]:
            print("YES")
            return

    # Check if Anton outscored a participant with a handle that was not red before the contest
    for name, (before, after) in ratings.items():
        for red_name, (red_before, red_after) in list(ratings.items()):
            if name!= red_name and after > red_before and after > red_after:
                print("YES")
                return

    # Print "NO" if no participant with a red handle was outscored
    print("NO")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

This updated solution correctly maps the colors to their corresponding rating ranges, checks if the rating of a participant increased after the contest, and handles the case where Anton outscored a participant with a handle that was not red before the contest.
