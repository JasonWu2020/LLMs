Here's an updated solution that meets the specifications:

```python
def stable_arrangement(n, k):
    def can_place(row, col, k):
        for i in range(len(row)):
            if row[i] == 'R':
                return False
        for i in range(len(row)):
            if board[i][col] == 'R':
                return False
        return True

    def place(row, col, k):
        if k == 0:
            return True
        for i in range(len(board)):
            if can_place(row, i, k):
                board[row][i] = 'R'
                if place(row, i + 1, k - 1):
                    return True
                board[row][i] = '.'
        return False

    board = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    if k > n:
        return -1
    if k == n:
        for row in board:
            print(''.join(row))
        return
    for i in range(n):
        if place(i, i, k):
            for row in board:
                print(''.join(row))
            return
    return -1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    result = stable_arrangement(n, k)
    if result!= -1:
        print()
    else:
        print(-1)
```

In this updated solution:

*   I added a `can_place` function to check if it's possible to place a rook at a given position on the board without violating the stability condition.
*   I modified the `place` function to try to place a rook at a given position on the board and recursively try to place the remaining rooks. If it finds a stable arrangement, it returns True. If it can't find a stable arrangement, it backtracks and tries a different placement.
*   I added a check to return immediately when k is equal to n, as there is no need to continue searching for a stable arrangement.
*   I modified the main loop to print the result according to the specifications. If there is a stable arrangement, it prints the arrangement with 'R' denoting the presence of a rook and '.' denoting an empty cell. If there is no stable arrangement, it prints -1.
