Here's the updated solution:

```python

    # Iterate through both arrays simultaneously
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):

```

However, this solution still has a problem. The issue is that it does not correctly handle the case where the common subsequence has multiple possible lengths. In this case, the solution should return any one of the possible common subsequences.

This updated solution uses dynamic programming to find the smallest common subsequence. It first fills a dp table to store the lengths of the common subsequences, then reconstructs the smallest common subsequence from the dp table.
