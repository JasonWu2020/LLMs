Certainly! Let's break down the problem and then provide a Python solution following the guidelines.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine which type of exercise (chest, biceps, or back) Greg will perform the most times based on the given list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` indicates how many times Greg repeats the `i`-th exercise. The exercises are performed in a cyclic manner: chest, biceps, back, chest, biceps, and so on.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
1. Initialize counters for the number of repetitions for each type of exercise.
2. Iterate through the list of integers and update the counters accordingly.
3. Determine which exercise has the highest count.
4. Print the result based on the exercise with the highest count.

### Python Solution
Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:

```python
# Read input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize counters for each type of exercise
chest_count = 0
biceps_count = 0
back_count = 0

# Perform the exercises in a cyclic manner
for i in range(n):
    if (i % 3 == 0):
        chest_count += a[i]
    elif (i % 3 == 1):
        biceps_count += a[i]
    else:
        back_count += a[i]

# Determine which exercise gets the most training
if chest_count >= biceps_count and chest_count >= back_count:
    print("chest")
elif biceps_count >= chest_count and biceps_count >= back_count:
    print("biceps")
else:
    print("back")
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the total number of exercises.
   - `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads the list of integers representing the number of repetitions for each exercise.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `chest_count`, `biceps_count`, and `back_count` are initialized to zero to keep track of the counts for each exercise type.

3. **Cyclic Exercise Execution**:
   - A loop iterates over the list of integers, using the modulo operator (`%`) to cycle through the exercises. For each exercise, we increment the respective counter.

4. **Determine Maximum Count**:
   - After iterating through all exercises, we compare the counts of each exercise type and print the corresponding muscle name based on the highest count.

### Testing the Solution
Let's test the provided solution with the given examples:

#### Example 1
Input:
```
6
2 8 0 5 1 10
```
Output:
```
biceps
```

#### Example 2
Input:
```
6
5 1 10 5 1 10
```
Output:
```
back
```

#### Example 3
Input:
```
6
18 12 8 18 12 8
```
Output:
```
chest
```

This solution should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the constraints.
