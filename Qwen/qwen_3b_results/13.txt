To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the minimum possible length of the array after performing the specified operations. Let's reason through it step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Operation**: 
   - We can only perform the operation if the two adjacent elements are different.
   - After performing the operation, the length of the array decreases by 1.

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the minimum possible length of the array after applying the operation as many times as possible.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - If we have an array where all elements are the same, no further operations can be performed since no adjacent elements are different.
   - If we have an array where all elements are distinct, we can keep performing the operation until we end up with one element.

Given these insights, here's how we can approach the solution:

- Count the frequency of each element in the array.
- If all elements have the same frequency, the array cannot be reduced further, so the answer is 1.
- If at least one element has a frequency greater than 1, we can always reduce the array to a single element.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def min_password_length(n, a):
    # Count the frequency of each element in the array
    freq = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1
    
    # Check if there is any element with a frequency greater than 1
    has_more_than_one = False
    for count in freq.values():
        if count > 1:
            has_more_than_one = True
            break
    
    # If there is at least one element with a frequency greater than 1, we can reduce to 1
    if has_more_than_one:
        return 1
    else:
        return len(a)

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = min_password_length(n, a)
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - We use a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each element in the array `a`.

2. **Check for Valid Operations**:
   - We check if there is any element whose frequency is greater than 1. If such an element exists, we can always perform the operation to reduce the array to a single element.
   - If no such element exists, the array already has a single element or all elements are the same.

3. **Output**:
   - Based on the presence of elements with more than one occurrence, we output the appropriate result.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for counting frequencies and another \(O(1)\) for checking conditions, making it suitable for the given constraints.
