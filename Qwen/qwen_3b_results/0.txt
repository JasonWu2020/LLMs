To solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsequence where each of the first $k$ letters appears with equal frequency.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values for $n$ and $k$, and the string $s$.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: Calculate the frequency of each of the first $k$ letters in the string $s$.
3. **Equal Frequency Check**: Identify if there exists a subsequence where the frequencies of all first $k$ letters are equal.
4. **Subsequence Length Calculation**: Find the length of the longest such subsequence.

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Create a list `freq` to store the frequency of each letter from 'A' to 'Z'.
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the current frequency and the maximum length of the subsequence found so far.

2. **Parse Input**:
   - Read the string $s$ and update the frequency of each letter in the list `freq`.

3. **Check Equal Frequencies**:
   - Iterate through the string $s$ while maintaining the current frequency of the first $k$ letters.
   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each letter up to the point where the frequencies match.

4. **Update Maximum Length**:
   - If a subsequence is found where all letters have the same frequency, update the maximum length accordingly.

### Python Implementation:

```python
def longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s):
    # Initialize frequency list for the first k letters
    freq = [0] * 26  # Index 0 to 25 corresponds to 'A' to 'Z'
    
    # Update the frequency of each letter in the string s
    for char in s:
        freq[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    
    max_length = 0
    current_freq = [0] * k
    
    # Iterate through the string s
    for char in s:
        idx = ord(char) - ord('A')
        current_freq[idx] += 1
        
        # Check if all k frequencies are equal
        if all(freq[i] == current_freq[i] for i in range(k)):
            max_length = len(s)
        
        # Remove the character at the beginning of the string
        if idx > 0:
            current_freq[(idx - 1) % k] -= 1
    
    return max_length

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n, k = map(int, data[:2])
    s = data[2]
    print(longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s))
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the input as specified and converts it into the required format.
- **Frequency Calculation**: The frequency of each letter in the string `s` is stored in the `freq` list.
- **Frequency Comparison**: The function checks if there exists a subsequence where the frequencies of the first $k$ letters are equal.
- **Maximum Length Update**: The maximum length of such a subsequence is updated during the iteration.

### Testing:
Ensure that the function works correctly by testing it with various inputs, including edge cases like empty strings or strings where no valid subsequence exists.

This solution efficiently finds the longest good subsequence using a single pass through the string `s`, making it suitable for large inputs up to $10^5$.
