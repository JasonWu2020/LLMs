Certainly! Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step in Python 3.8.

### Problem Analysis
- We have `a` red socks and `b` blue socks.
- Each day, Vasya wears one red and one blue sock.
- We need to find:
  1. The maximum number of consecutive days he can wear different socks.
  2. After that, the number of days he can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot form a pair.

### Steps to Solve
1. **Determine the maximum number of days Vasya can wear different socks**: This is simply the minimum of the number of red socks and blue socks because each day requires one red and one blue sock.
2. **Calculate the remaining socks after the maximum number of different socks days**: Subtract the number of socks used in these days from the initial counts of red and blue socks.

### Solution Implementation

Here is the Python 3.8 code:

```python
def solve_socks(a, b):
    # Determine the maximum number of consecutive days Vasya can wear different socks
    max_days_different = min(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the remaining socks after these days
    remaining_red = a - max_days_different
    remaining_blue = b - max_days_different
    
    return max_days_different, remaining_red + remaining_blue

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Solve and print the result
max_days_different, remaining_days = solve_socks(a, b)
print(max_days_different, remaining_days)
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Function `solve_socks`**:
   - Takes the number of red socks `a` and blue socks `b`.
   - Computes the maximum number of days (`max_days_different`) by taking the minimum of `a` and `b`.
   - Calculates the remaining socks after these days: `remaining_red = a - max_days_different` and `remaining_blue = b - max_days_different`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the values of `a` and `b` from the input.

3. **Printing Output**:
   - Calls `solve_socks` with `a` and `b`, and prints the results.

### Example
Let's consider the example where `a = 3` (red socks) and `b = 5` (blue socks).

- The maximum number of days Vasya can wear different socks is `min(3, 5) = 3`.
- After these 3 days, he will have `3 - 3 = 0` red socks and `5 - 3 = 2` blue socks left.

So, the output would be `3 2`.

This solution adheres to the problem's constraints and specifications.
