Certainly! Let's start by writing a Python3.8 program to solve this problem. The solution involves a simple mathematical observation: the minimum number of moves required to make \(a\) divisible by \(b\) is equal to the remainder when \(a\) is divided by \(b\).

Hereâ€™s how we can implement it:

```python
def min_moves_to_divide(a, b):
    # Calculate the remainder of a divided by b
    remainder = a % b
    # If remainder is 0, no moves needed
    if remainder == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return remainder

# Read input
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    result = min_moves_to_divide(a, b)
    print(result)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `min_moves_to_divide` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. This function calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
2. **Input Reading**: We read the number of test cases `t` from the first line. For each test case, we read two integers `a` and `b` from subsequent lines.
3. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, we call the `min_moves_to_divide` function and print the result.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `2`
- `a = 7`, `b = 5`
- Calculation: `remainder = 7 % 5 = 2`
- Output: `2`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `2`
- `a = 10`, `b = 3`
- Calculation: `remainder = 10 % 3 = 1`
- Output: `1`

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of moves required for each test case efficiently.

### Testing the Solution:
To ensure correctness, you can test your solution with various inputs. Make sure the function works correctly for edge cases like when `a` is exactly divisible by `b`.

This solution adheres to the problem constraints and provides an efficient way to solve the problem.
