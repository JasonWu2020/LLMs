Here's a Python solution that adheres to the given specifications:

```python
def can_play_card(table_card, hand_cards):
    # Extracting the rank and suit from the table card
    table_rank, table_suit = table_card[0], table_card[1]
    
    # Check if any card in the hand matches the rank or suit of the table card
    for card in hand_cards:
        card_rank, card_suit = card[0], card[1]
        
        # Check if the card's rank matches the table card's rank
        if card_rank == table_rank:
            return "YES"
        # Check if the card's suit matches the table card's suit
        elif card_suit == table_suit:
            return "YES"
    
    # If no suitable card is found, return "NO"
    return "NO"

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Reading input
    table_card = input().strip()
    hand_cards = [input().strip() for _ in range(5)]
    
    # Checking if a card can be played and printing the result
    print(can_play_card(table_card, hand_cards))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - `can_play_card(table_card, hand_cards)` takes two arguments: 
     - `table_card`: The card on the table, represented as a string.
     - `hand_cards`: A list of five strings representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Extracting Card Information**:
   - `table_rank` and `table_suit` are extracted from the `table_card`.
   
3. **Checking Hand Cards**:
   - For each card in the `hand_cards`, its rank (`card_rank`) and suit (`card_suit`) are extracted.
   - It checks if the rank or suit of the card matches the rank or suit of the table card.
   - If either condition is met, it returns `"YES"` immediately.
   - If no such card is found after checking all five cards, it returns `"NO"`.

4. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the table card and five hand cards from standard input.
   - Calls the `can_play_card` function and prints the result.

### Example Outputs:
- **Example 1**:
  ```
  AS
  AD AS 4D 5S 6H
  ```
  Output: `YES`
  - An Ace of Diamonds can be played since it has the same rank as the Ace of Spades.

- **Example 2**:
  ```
  4S
  5H 6S 7D 8C 9H
  ```
  Output: `NO`
  - No card has the same rank or suit as the Four of Spades.

- **Example 3**:
  ```
  4D
  AD 4D 5S 6H 7C
  ```
  Output: `YES`
  - An Ace of Diamonds can be played since it has the same suit as the Four of Diamonds.

This solution reads the input correctly and follows the specified output format.
