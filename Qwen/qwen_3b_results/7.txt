Certainly! Let's break down the solution step-by-step for this problem.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of `S` such that `T` (which is a permutation of "abc") is not a subsequence of this permutation.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Subsequence**: We first identify the positions of characters in `S` that match characters in `T`.
2. **Construct the Lexicographically Smallest Permutation**:
   - For each position where `T` could appear, we choose the smallest available character from `S` to avoid having `T` as a subsequence.
   - If there are multiple choices, we pick the smallest character from the remaining ones.

### Python Implementation

```python
def find_lex_smallest_permutation(S, T):
    # Convert T to a list for easier manipulation
    T_list = list(T)
    
    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the indices of each character in S
    char_indices = {}
    for i, char in enumerate(S):
        if char in char_indices:
            char_indices[char].append(i)
        else:
            char_indices[char] = [i]
    
    # Sort the indices for each character
    for char in char_indices:
        char_indices[char].sort()
    
    # Construct the result string
    result = []
    for char in T_list:
        if not result:
            # If no characters have been placed yet, place the smallest character available
            for index in char_indices[char]:
                result.append(chr(index + ord('a')))
                char_indices[char].remove(index)
                break
        else:
            # Place the next smallest character that doesn't create a subsequence
            for index in char_indices[char]:
                if index >= len(result) or result[index] != chr(index + ord('a')):
                    result.append(chr(index + ord('a')))
                    char_indices[char].remove(index)
                    break
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

for line in data[1:]:
    S, T = line.split()
    result = find_lex_smallest_permutation(S, T)
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - We convert `T` into a list for easier manipulation.
   - We create a dictionary to store the indices of each character in `S`.

2. **Sorting Indices**:
   - We sort the indices of each character in `S` to ensure that when we place characters, we always consider the smallest possible character.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - We iterate through each character in `T` and place it in the result string.
   - We use the sorted indices to place the smallest available character that doesn't create a subsequence.

4. **Output**:
   - We join the result list into a string and print it.

### Testing the Solution

To test the solution, you can provide sample inputs and outputs. Here's an example of how to run the solution with some test cases:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases = [
        ("aaaabbc", "abc"),
        ("cccba", "acb"),
        ("dbsic", "bac")
    ]
    
    for S, T in test_cases:
        result = find_lex_smallest_permutation(S, T)
        print(f"For input {S} and {T}, the result is {result}")
```

This should give you the expected results based on the provided examples. The solution should work efficiently within the constraints given.
