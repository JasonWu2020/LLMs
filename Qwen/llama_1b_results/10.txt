Here's an updated solution in Python 3.8:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
days = 0
while a > 0 and b > 0:
    if a > 0:
        days += 1
        a -= 1
    else:
        days += 1
        b -= 1
print(days, b)
```

In this code, we use a while loop to iterate through the socks until either `a` or `b` is 0. We increment the day counter `days` and decrement `a` and `b` accordingly. The loop ends when either `a` or `b` is 0. The number of days is then printed.

This solution meets the requirements and is concise and readable. It also follows the specified format.
