Here's an updated solution in Python that reads the input and prints the solution according to the specifications:

```python
def can_play(mau_mau, table, hand):
    """
    Check if it's possible to play a card from the hand in the Mau-Mau game.

    Args:
        mau_mau (str): The card on the table.
        table (str): The cards in the hand.
        hand (str): The cards in the hand.

    Returns:
        str: "YES" if it's possible to play a card, "NO" otherwise.
    """

    # Convert the table and hand strings to lists of integers
    table = [ord(c) - ord('A') for c in table]
    hand = [ord(c) - ord('A') for c in hand]

    # Check if there's an Ace in the table
    has_ace = table.count(0) > 0

    # Check if there's a pair in the table
    has_pair = len(set(table) == 1)

    # Check if there's a pair in the hand
    has_pair_in_hand = len(set(hand) == 1)

    # Check if there's a pair in the table that matches the hand
    for rank in range(2, 10):
        if rank in table and table[rank - 1] in hand:
            return "YES"

    # If there's an Ace in the table, you can play any card
    if has_ace:
        return "YES"

    # If there's a pair in the hand, you can play any card
    if has_pair_in_hand:
        return "YES"

    # If there's no Aces in the hand, you can play any card
    return "YES"

# Test the function
table = input().strip()
hand = input().strip()
print(can_play(table, hand, hand))
```

This updated solution checks if there's a pair in the table that matches the hand, and returns "YES" if it finds one. It also checks for the case where there are no Aces in the hand, and returns "YES" in that case.
