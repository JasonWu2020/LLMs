Here's an updated solution that reads the input and prints the solution according to the specifications:

```python
def min_shovels(k, r):
    # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to reach the given amount
    c = math.ceil((k - 1) / r)
    return c

def main():
    # Read the input
    k = int(input("Enter the price of one shovel: "))
    r = int(input("Enter the denomination of the coin: "))

    # Calculate the minimum number of shovels needed to pay for the given amount
    min_shovels_needed = min_shovels(k, r)

    # Print the result
    print("Minimum number of shovels needed to pay for", k, "burles:", min_shovels_needed)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code prompts the user to input the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin, calculates the minimum number of shovels needed to pay for the given amount, and then prints the result.

Note that this code uses the `math.ceil` function to round up to the nearest integer, which is the same as the `ceil` function in Python 3.8. This is because the problem statement asks for the minimum number of shovels needed to pay without any change, which is equivalent to rounding up to the nearest integer.
