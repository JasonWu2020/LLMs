```python
def final_array(a, k):
    n = len(a)
    max_val = max(a)
    min_val = min(a)

    for _ in range(k):
        max_val = max(max_val, max(a))
        min_val = min(min_val, min(a))

    a[:] = [max_val - a[i] for i in range(n)]

    return a

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    print(*final_array(a, k))
```

This code defines a function `final_array` that takes the array and the number of operations as input, performs the operations, and returns the final array. The test cases are handled in a loop that reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads the array and the number of operations, and prints the final array after the operations.

This code follows the specifications and is well-structured, readable, and concise. It also handles the edge case where the array contains only one element.
