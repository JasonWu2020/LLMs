Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % b == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        moves = 0
        while a % b!= 0:
            a += 1
            moves += 1
        print(moves)
```

This code first checks if `a` is already divisible by `b`. If it is, the function prints 0 as per the problem statement. If not, it increments `a` by 1 and adds 1 to the moves count until `a` becomes divisible by `b`. This is the minimum number of moves required to make `a` divisible by `b`.
