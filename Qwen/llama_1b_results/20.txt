Here's the updated code that reads the input and prints the solution according to the specifications:

```python
def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        result = 0
        while n > 0:
            result = (result & (n - 1)) | ((n - 1) & n)
            n -= 1
        print(result)

solve()
```

This code works by repeatedly performing the bitwise AND operation with `n-1` until `n` becomes 0. The result is the maximum value of `k` that satisfies the condition. This is because when `n` becomes 0, the bitwise AND operation with `n` will result in 0.
