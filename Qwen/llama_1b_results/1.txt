This Python code defines a function `min_invitations` that takes the number of friends `n` and a list of friend indices `p` as input. It creates a dictionary `friends` to store the friends of each friend, and a set `friends_set` to store the friends of each friend. It then iterates over the friends to count the number of friends of each friend and increments the invitations accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum number of invitations by summing up the counts of friends of each friend minus 1.

The code also includes a loop to read the number of test cases and the friends for each test case, and a loop to print the minimum number of invitations for each test case.

Note: This code assumes that the input is valid, i.e., the number of friends is between 2 and 50, and the friends are distinct.
