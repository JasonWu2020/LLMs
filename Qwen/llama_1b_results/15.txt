Here is the updated solution in Python 3.8:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def check_winner(ratings):
    winner = None
    highest_before = float('-inf')
    for name, before in ratings.items():
        if before > highest_before:
            winner = name
            highest_before = before

    if winner is None:
        return False

    for name, after in ratings.items():
        if after > highest_before and after >= highest_before:
            return True

    return False


n = int(input())
ratings = defaultdict(int)
previous_ratings = defaultdict(int)

for _ in range(n):
    name, before, after = input().split()
    ratings[name] = int(after)
    previous_ratings[name] = int(before)

print("YES" if check_winner(ratings) else "NO")
```

The main function remains the same as before. The only change is that the dictionary keys are now `name` instead of `name` (note the lowercase `name`). The solution now correctly reads the input and prints the result according to the specifications.
