Here's the updated solution:

```python
def decrypt(s):
    decrypted = ""
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i]!= s[i - 1]:
            decrypted += s[i]
    return decrypted

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(decrypt(s))
```

In this updated solution, we initialize an empty string `decrypted` to store the decrypted string. We then iterate over the string `s` in reverse order, adding each character to the `decrypted` string if it is different from the previous character. This is the same as the original solution. The final decrypted string is then printed.

However, we can make the code more concise and readable by using a generator expression to filter out the characters that are different from the previous character:

```python
def decrypt(s):
    return "".join(c for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1) if s[i]!= s[i - 1])

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(decrypt(s))
```

This version of the function uses a generator expression to create a new string that only includes the characters that are different from the previous character, and then joins them together to form the decrypted string.
