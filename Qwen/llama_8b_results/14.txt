Here's an updated solution that reads the input and prints the solution according to the specifications:

```python
import math

def solve(n, k, arr):
    # Find the maximum value in the array
    d = max(arr)

    # Calculate the GCD of the absolute values of all elements
    gcd_val = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(gcd_val, abs(arr[i]))

    # Calculate the number of operations it takes for all elements to become zero
    operations_to_zero = 0
    for i in range(n):
        operations_to_zero = max(operations_to_zero, abs(arr[i]) // gcd_val)

    # Determine the final state of the array
    final_array = []
    remaining_operations = k % operations_to_zero
    if remaining_operations == 0:
        for num in arr:
            final_array.append(d - num)
    elif remaining_operations == operations_to_zero:
        for num in arr:
            final_array.append(-num)
    else:
        for num in arr:
            if abs(num) % gcd_val == 0:
                final_array.append(0)
            else:
                final_array.append(d - (num % gcd_val))

    # Print the final array
    for i in range(0, len(final_array), n):
        for j in range(n):
            if j < len(final_array) - i:
                print(final_array[i + j], end=" ")
            else:
                print(0, end=" ")
        print()

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    solve(n, k, arr)
```

The changes made were:

1.  The `final_array` is now populated with the correct values after the operations. If `remaining_operations` is 0, the array is the negation of the original array. If `remaining_operations` is equal to `operations_to_zero`, the array is the negation of the original array. Otherwise, the array has a mix of zeros and non-zero values.
2.  The `final_array` is printed in the correct format, with each row representing the array after each operation.
