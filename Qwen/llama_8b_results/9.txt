Here's an updated solution:

```python
def most_exercise(n, exercises):
    """
    Determine which muscle gets the most exercise.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of exercises.
    exercises (list): A list of integers representing the number of times each exercise is repeated.

    Returns:
    str: The muscle that gets the most exercise.
    """
    # Initialize the counts for each muscle
    chest_count = 0
    biceps_count = 0
    back_count = 0

    # Calculate the number of exercises for each muscle
    for i in range(n):
        exercise = exercises[i % 3]  # Use the modulus operator to cycle through the exercises
        if i % 3 == 0:  # If the exercise is a "chest" exercise
            chest_count += exercise
        elif i % 3 == 1:  # If the exercise is a "biceps" exercise
            biceps_count += exercise
        else:  # If the exercise is a "back" exercise
            back_count += exercise

    # Determine which muscle gets the most exercise
    max_count = max(chest_count, biceps_count, back_count)
    if max_count == chest_count:
        return "chest "
    elif max_count == biceps_count:
        return " biceps "
    else:
        return " back "

# Get the number of exercises from the user
n = int(input())

# Get the exercises from the user
exercises = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Determine which muscle gets the most exercise
result = most_exercise(n, exercises)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This solution uses a for loop to iterate over the exercises and calculate the count for each muscle. It uses the modulus operator to cycle through the exercises. It then determines which muscle gets the most exercise by finding the maximum count and comparing it to the counts for each muscle. Finally, it prints the result according to the specifications.
