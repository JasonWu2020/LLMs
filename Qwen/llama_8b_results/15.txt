The provided solution has several issues:

1. It doesn't handle the case where Anton's rating is not provided in the input. We need to read Anton's rating and store it in a variable.
2. The `determine_color` function is not being used correctly. It should be used to determine the color of Anton's handle based on his rating.
3. The `check_result` function is not correctly checking if Anton outscored any of the participants who had a red handle before the contest and had their rating increased after the contest.
4. The `check_result` function is not returning 'YES' when Anton outscored a participant. It should return 'YES' as soon as it finds a participant who was outscored by Anton.

Here is an updated solution:

```python
def determine_color(rating):
    if rating >= 2400:
        return'red'
    elif rating >= 2200:
        return 'orange'
    elif rating >= 2000:
        return 'yellow'
    elif rating >= 1800:
        return 'green'
    elif rating >= 1600:
        return 'light_green'
    elif rating >= 1400:
        return 'light_green2'
    elif rating >= 1200:
        return 'light_green3'
    elif rating >= 1000:
        return 'light_green4'
    elif rating >= 800:
        return 'light_green5'
    elif rating >= 600:
        return 'light_green6'
    elif rating >= 400:
        return 'light_green7'
    else:
        return 'gray'

def check_result(contest_results, Anton):
    Anton_before, Anton_after = map(int, input().split())
    Anton_color = determine_color(Anton_before)
    
    red_participants = {}
    for name, before, after in contest_results:
        if determine_color(before) =='red' and after > before:
            red_participants[name] = after

    for name, before, after in contest_results:
        if name!= Anton and determine_color(after) =='red' and after > before and after > Anton_after:
            return 'YES'

    return 'NO'

# Input
n = int(input())
contest_results = []
for _ in range(n):
    name, before, after = input().split()
    before, after = int(before), int(after)
    contest_results.append((name, before, after))

# Print Anton's rating
Anton = input()
print("YES" if check_result(contest_results, Anton) else "NO")
```

This solution reads the input, determines the color of Anton's handle, and then checks if Anton outscored any of the participants who had a red handle before the contest and had their rating increased after the contest. If Anton outscored a participant, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.
