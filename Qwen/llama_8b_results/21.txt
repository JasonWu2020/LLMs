The previous solution does not meet the output specification, which requires printing only one integer - the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins. The solution I provided earlier prints the number of unique coin values, but this is not necessarily the minimum number of pockets needed.

Here's an updated solution that meets the output specification:

```python
def min_pockets(n, coins):
    # Create a frequency map to store the count of each coin value
    freq_map = {}
    
    # Populate the frequency map
    for coin in coins:
        if coin in freq_map:
            freq_map[coin] += 1
        else:
            freq_map[coin] = 1
    
    # Initialize the minimum number of pockets needed
    min_pockets = 0
    
    # Initialize a list to store the sorted frequencies
    sorted_freqs = []
    
    # Iterate through the frequency map
    for freq in freq_map.values():
        # If the frequency is greater than 0, add it to the sorted frequencies
        if freq > 0:
            sorted_freqs.append(freq)
    
    # Sort the frequencies in descending order
    sorted_freqs.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize the current pocket and the minimum number of pockets needed
    current_pocket = 0
    min_pockets = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted frequencies
    for freq in sorted_freqs:
        # If the current pocket is empty, increment the minimum number of pockets and reset the current pocket
        if current_pocket == 0:
            min_pockets += 1
            current_pocket = 1
        # Add the frequency to the current pocket
        current_pocket += 1
    
    # Increment the minimum number of pockets if the current pocket is not empty
    if current_pocket!= 0:
        min_pockets += 1
    
    return min_pockets

# Read the input
n = int(input())
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Call the function and print the result
print(min_pockets(n, coins))
```

This solution first creates a frequency map of the coin values, then sorts the frequencies in descending order. It initializes a variable to keep track of the current pocket and iterates through the sorted frequencies, incrementing the minimum number of pockets as needed. Finally, it prints the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins.

This solution meets the output specification and has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of unique coin values. The space complexity is O(n) for the frequency map.
