The outputted solution has a few issues:

1.  It does not handle the case when the input string is empty. In this case, the loop `for i in range(1, n):` will throw an error because `n` is 0.
2.  It does not handle the case when the input string contains only one character. In this case, there is no balanced substring, so it should print -1 -1.
3.  It does not print the solution according to the specification. It should print the solution on a new line for each test case.

Here's an updated solution that addresses these issues:

```python
def find_balanced_substring():
    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()  # Remove leading and trailing whitespace

        if n == 0 or (n == 1 and s!= 'a' and s!= 'b'):  # Handle empty string and string with one character
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            l, r = 1, 1
            diff = 0

            for i in range(1, n):
                if s[i] == 'a':
                    diff += 1
                else:
                    diff -= 1

                if diff == 0:
                    print(l, i + 1)
                    break
                elif i == n - 1:
                    if diff == 0:
                        print(l, n)
                    else:
                        print(-1, -1)

find_balanced_substring()
```

This updated solution:

*   Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the input string using `strip()`.
*   Checks if the input string is empty or contains only one character, and prints -1 -1 in these cases.
*   Prints the solution on a new line for each test case.
