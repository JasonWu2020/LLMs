Here's an updated solution in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def solve(S, T):
    # Count the frequency of each character in string S
    freq = Counter(S)
    
    # Determine the condition for not containing T as a subsequence
    if freq['a'] >= 1 and freq['b'] >= 1 and freq['c'] >= 1:
        # Place the 'c's in S'
        c_count = min(freq['c'], freq['a'], freq['b'])
        
        # Place the 'a's and 'b's in S'
        a_chars = S[:c_count].count('a')
        b_chars = S[:c_count].count('b')
        
        # Fill the remaining characters in S'
        remaining_chars = sorted([char for char in S if char not in 'abc' or (char in 'abc' and S.index(char) < c_count)])
        
        # Return the resulting string S'
        return ''.join('c' * c_count + 'a' * a_chars + 'b' * b_chars + remaining_chars)
    else:
        # If the string T is not a subsequence of S, return S
        return S

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Process each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the strings S and T
    S = input()
    T = input()
    
    # Solve the problem and print the result
    print(solve(S, T))
```

The main changes made were:

*   The condition for not containing T as a subsequence was simplified to just check if all characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' have a count of at least 1.
*   The placement of 'c's, 'a's, and 'b's in S' was modified to ensure that the 'c's are placed first, followed by the 'a's and 'b's.
*   The remaining characters in S' are sorted to ensure that they are placed in lexicographical order.
*   The solution now directly constructs the resulting string S' by concatenating the 'c's, 'a's, 'b's, and remaining characters.
*   The input and output are now read and printed according to the problem specifications.

This updated solution should produce the correct output for all test cases.
