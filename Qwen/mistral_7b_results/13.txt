[/INST] The provided code correctly solves the problem, but it can be improved in a few ways to better adhere to the problem specifications. Here's an updated solution:

1. Read the number of test cases and store it in a variable.
2. For each test case, read the length of the password and its initial contents.
3. Call the `find_shortest_password_length` function to find the shortest possible length of the password.
4. Print the answer for the current test case.

Here's the updated Python 3.8 solution:

```python
def find_shortest_password_length(arr):
    min_val, max_val = min(arr), max(arr)

    if min_val == max_val:
        return len(arr)

    count = 0
    while len(arr) > 2:
        i = arr.index(min(arr[:-1]) if arr[-1] != min(arr[:-1]) else arr.index(min(arr[:-1]) - 1)
        arr[i:i+2] = [arr[i]+arr[i+1]]
        count += 1

    return len(arr) + count

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Process each test case
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Find the shortest possible password length
    length = find_shortest_password_length(arr)

    # Print the answer
    print(length)
```

This updated solution should correctly read the input and print the output according to the problem specifications.</s>
