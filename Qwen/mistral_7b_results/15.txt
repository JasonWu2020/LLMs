[/INST] The provided solution reads and processes the input correctly, but it doesn't print the output in the required format, which is to print "YES" or "NO" enclosed in quotes for clarity. Here's an updated solution that reads the input, checks if Anton has performed good, and prints the output according to the specifications:

```python
# Function to check if a handle was red before the contest
def was_red(rating):
    return rating >= 2400

# Function to read and process the input
def process_input():
    n = int(input())
    participants = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, before, after = input().split()
        before = int(before)
        after = int(after)
        participants.append((name, before, after))
    return participants

# Main function to determine if Anton performed good
def performed_good(participants):
    for participant in participants:
        name, before, after = participant
        if was_red(before) and after > before:
            return True
    return False

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    participants = process_input()
    result = performed_good(participants)
    print('"{}"'.format("YES" if result else "NO"))
```

This updated solution reads the input, processes it, checks if Anton has performed good, and prints the output in the required format.</s>
