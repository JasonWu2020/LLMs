[/INST] The given solution is correct in terms of logic, but it needs some improvements to meet the input and output specifications of the problem. Here's an updated solution that reads the input correctly and prints the output in the required format:

```python
def can_play_card(table_card, hand_cards):
    table_rank, table_suit = table_card
    for hand_card in hand_cards:
        hand_rank, hand_suit = hand_card
        if (table_rank == hand_rank or table_suit == hand_suit):
            return True
    return False

# Read the input
table_card_str, hand_cards_str = input().split()
table_card = tuple(map(str, table_card_str.split()))
hand_cards = [tuple(map(str, card.split())) for card in hand_cards_str.split(',')]

# Call the function and print the output
if can_play_card(table_card, hand_cards):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This updated solution reads the input as a single string for the table card and a single string for the hand cards, then splits each string into two parts using the `split()` method. It also uses a list comprehension to create a list of tuples for the hand cards. The rest of the logic remains the same as the previous solution.

Note that since the input specification states that the input is given as separate strings for the table card and hand cards, this updated solution assumes that the input is given in that format, even though the original problem statement did not explicitly state that. If the input is actually given as a single string with all the cards separated by commas, then the previous solution would be more appropriate.</s>
