[/INST] The given code correctly solves the problem and meets the output specification. However, the code could be improved in a few ways to make it more concise and readable.

First, the name of the function `smallest_multiple` is not descriptive enough, as it doesn't clearly indicate that it returns the smallest multiple of 10 that is also a multiple of the given denomination. A better name for the function might be `multiple_of_ten_and_r`.

Second, the calculation of the minimum number of shovels could be simplified by observing that the number of shovels is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the quotient of the smallest multiple of 10 that is also a multiple of r, divided by the price of one shovel. This avoids the need to add 1 to the result of the quotient.

Here's the updated Python code:

```python
def multiple_of_ten_and_r(k, r):
    """
    Returns the smallest multiple of 10 that is also a multiple of r.
    """
    return (k * (r // 10) + r) // r

def min_shovels(k, r):
    """
    Returns the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy to pay for them without any change.
    """
    shovels = multiple_of_ten_and_r(k, r) // k
    return shovels

k = int(input())
r = int(input())
shovels = min_shovels(k, r)
print(shovels)
```

This code defines two functions: `multiple_of_ten_and_r` and `min_shovels`. The `multiple_of_ten_and_r` function finds the smallest multiple of 10 that is also a multiple of the given denomination. The `min_shovels` function uses this to calculate the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy.

The input and output are read and printed according to the problem specification.</s>
