[/INST] The solution I provided earlier is correct according to the problem statement, but it does not follow the exact input and output specifications given. The problem statement asks for reading the input from standard input and printing the output to standard output. Here's the corrected version of the code that follows the input and output specifications:

```python
def distribute_coins():
    import sys
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    coins = []
    for _ in range(n):
        coins.append(int(sys.stdin.readline()))
    coins.sort()
    pockets = [coins[0]]
    for coin in coins[1:]:
        if coin != pockets[-1]:
            pockets.append(coin)
    print(len(pockets))

# Example usage:
distribute_coins()
```

This version of the code reads the input from standard input using the `sys.stdin.readline()` function and prints the output to standard output using the `print` function. The rest of the code remains the same as in the earlier solution.

You can test this code with the example input given in the problem statement by running it in a Python interpreter and providing the input as follows:

```
6
1 2 4 3 3 2
```

This should print the output `4`.</s>
