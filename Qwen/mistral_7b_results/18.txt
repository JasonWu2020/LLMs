[/INST] The solution I provided earlier correctly solves the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem, but it does not fully adhere to the given input and output specifications. Here's an updated solution that addresses those issues.

```python
def lcs(a, b):
    n = len(a)
    m = len(b)
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    if dp[n][m] == 0:
        return "NO"

    length = dp[n][m]
    subsequence = []

    i, j = n, m
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
            subsequence.append(a[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    return "YES", length, list(reversed(subsequence))

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        answer = lcs(a, b)
        if isinstance(answer, str):
            print(answer)
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(*answer[1:])
            print(len(answer[1]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated solution reads the input according to the given specifications, prints "YES" followed by the length and the subsequence if a solution exists, and prints "NO" otherwise. Additionally, it prints the length of the subsequence on a separate line when it is required in the output specification.</s>
