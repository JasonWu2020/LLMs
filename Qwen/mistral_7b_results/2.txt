[/INST] The provided Python3.8 solution correctly solves the problem as stated in the problem description. However, there are some minor issues with the code that can be improved:

1. The input validation is not included in the code, so it is assumed that the input will always be valid. However, it is important to validate the input to ensure that the input is within the given constraints.
2. The output format is not exactly as specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the output should be "Yes" or "No" with any case, but the code outputs "Yes" or "No" in lowercase. To make the code match the problem description, we can simply change the output to be all uppercase.

Here's the updated Python3.8 solution:

```python
def is_possible(n, a, b):
    # Check if the given conditions are valid
    if a > n or b > n or (a + b) > n:
        return "NO"

    # Create two arrays for storing the position of each number in the first and second permutations
    first_permutation = [0] * n
    second_permutation = [0] * n

    # Fill the arrays
    for i in range(n):
        # Fill the position of i in the first permutation
        j = i - a
        if j >= 0 and first_permutation[j] != 0 and first_permutation[j] != i:
            continue
        first_permutation[i] = i

        # Fill the position of i in the second permutation
        j = i + b
        if j >= n or second_permutation[j] != 0 and second_permutation[j] != i:
            continue
        second_permutation[i] = i

    # Check if both arrays are filled successfully
    for i in range(n):
        if first_permutation[i] == 0 or second_permutation[i] == 0:
            return "NO"

    # Output the result
    return "YES"

# Test cases
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(is_possible(n, a, b).upper())
```

This updated solution validates the input, ensures the output format matches the problem description, and returns the result in uppercase as required.</s>
