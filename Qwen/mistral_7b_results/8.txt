[/INST] Here's an updated solution that reads the input according to the problem statement and prints the output in the required format:

```python
def max_stones(a, b, c):
    """
    Return the maximum number of stones Alice can take using the given heaps.
    """
    if not (a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0):
        return 0

    operations = [
        (a / 2, "a"),
        (b / 2, "b"),
        (c / 2, "c")
    ]

    operations.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)

    stones = 0
    operations_performed = []
    while operations and stones < 1e9:
        stones_gained, heap = operations.pop()
        if (stones + stones_gained > 0 and stones + stones_gained <= (2 * (1 if heap == "a" else 1 + operations_performed[-1][0])):
            stones += stones_gained
            operations_performed.append((stones_gained, heap))

    return stones

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        result = max_stones(a, b, c)
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated solution reads the input as specified and prints the output as required. It also includes a check for the maximum possible number of stones (1e9) to ensure that Alice cannot take more stones than the maximum possible number.</s>
