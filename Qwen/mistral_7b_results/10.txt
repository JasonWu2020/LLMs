[/INST] The given Python solution correctly calculates the number of days Vasya can wear different socks and the same socks, but it lacks proper input and output handling according to the problem statement. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
def main():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    days_different = min(a, b)
    days_same = 2 * (a + b) - days_different
    print(f"{days_different} {days_same}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input() # consume the empty line
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(f"Maximum number of days wearing different socks: {a}, Maximum number of days wearing the same socks: {days_same}")
```

This code reads the empty line at the beginning to consume the input newline character and then reads the input as specified by the problem statement. The output is printed following the problem's requirements.</s>
