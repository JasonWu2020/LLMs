```python
import math

# Read input
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Check if r is a factor of k
if k % r == 0:
    print(1)
else:
    # Calculate the LCM of r and 10
    lcm = r * (10 // math.gcd(r, 10))
    
    # If the LCM is greater than 10r, return the ceiling of k / r
    if lcm > 10 * r:
        print(math.ceil(k / r))
    else:
        # If the LCM is 10, 2r, 5r, or 10r, return 1
        print(1)
```

This code reads the input from the user, checks if `r` is a factor of `k`, and calculates the LCM of `r` and 10. It then uses this LCM to determine the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy. If the LCM is greater than 10r, it returns the ceiling of `k / r`. Otherwise, it returns 1.
