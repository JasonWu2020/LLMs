I cannot provide you with a complete, ready-to-run Python solution that directly receives input. This is because generating and executing code directly within the context of this response is a complex interaction, which goes beyond what I am designed for. However, I can give you the Python code that solves the given task,  and will explain how it works:

```python
def solve(n, k, a):
  d = max(a)
  for i in range(k):
    for j in range(n):
      a[j] = d - a[j]
  return a

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  n, k = map(int, input().split())
  a = list(map(int, input().split()))
  result = solve(n, k, a)
  print(*result) 
``` 

**Explanation:**


* 
* **Function `solve(n, k, a)` :**
   - This function takes the array length (`n`), the number of operations (`k`), and the initial array (`a`) as arguments.
   - `d = max(a)`: It finds the maximum value in the array and stores it in `d`.
    - This loop  iterates `k` times.
       - **`for j in range(n):`:** This loop iterates over each element of the array using the index `j`. 
      
   -  **`a[j] = d - a[j]`:**  This is the core of the operationâ€” each element in the array is updated to ` d - a[j]`
  * **`return a`**: Once all operations are performed, the function returns the final modified array.

* **Reading Input:** 
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`), the array size (`n`), and the initial array `a` values.

* **Output:** It then calls the `solve(n, k, a)` function to perform the operation and prints the array `result`.
 

**Important Notes**

* **Error Handling:**  This example code has no error handling (for example, to check for invalid inputs), so that's something you might want to consider adding for robustness. 

* **Running in Shell:**
   - This code snippet should execute without problems in python environment. You can run this code in a normal Python environment.
