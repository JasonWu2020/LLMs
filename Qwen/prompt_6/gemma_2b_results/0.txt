    max_len = 0
    for i in range(k):
        value = letters[chr(i + ord('A')])
        
        if value in set(letters.values()):
            for c in letters:
                if c.islower():
                    print(letters)              
        max_len = max(max_len, value + 1)

print(longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s))
``` 

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** An empty `letters` dictionary is created to store the frequency of each letter from 'A' to 'k'. These keys will be letters, with values being counts.
2. **Reading the Input:** The input is read and then organized into a dictionary.  The logic for this is built into the `longest_good_subsequence` function. 
3.  **Determining the Length of the Longest Good Subsequence:**
   - A function `longest_good_subsequence`  is defined that iterates over the alphabet, uses a function to determine if the string is a good subsequence using the dictionary.
4. **Printing the Result:**   The answer is printed directly. 


**Important Considerations:** 


* **Case/Input Formatting:**  Make sure that the input is correctly formatted (e.g., uppercase, one input at a time)



This implementation uses an iterative approach to determine the length of the longest good subsequence.
