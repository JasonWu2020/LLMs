```python
def min_pockets(n, a):
  a_sorted = sorted(a)  
  pockets = 0
  current_pocket = [] 
  for coin in a_sorted:
    if coin not in current_pocket:
      current_pocket.append(coin)
      pockets += 1
  return pockets

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = min_pockets(n, a)
print(result)   


   ``` 


**Explanation:**

* **`min_pockets(n, a)` Function:**
   * Takes the number of coins (`n`) and an array of coin values (`a`) as input.
   * Sorts the coin values in ascending order (`a_sorted`). This step is crucial for placing coins efficiently.
   * Initializes `pockets` to 0 (representing the initial count of used pockets) and `current_pocket` to an empty list. 
   * Iterates through each coin in the `a_sorted` array. 
      * For each coin that's not already in `current_pocket`:
         * It is added to `current_pocket`.
         * The `pockets` count is increased by one. 
   * Returns the final number of used pockets (`pockets`).  
 * **Main program:**
     * Reads the number of coins (`n`).
     * Reads the values of the coins as a list of integers.
     * Calls the `min_pockets` function to calculate the minimum number of pockets.
     * Prints the result. 

**Key Ideas**

* **Sorting:** The step of sorting the coins is crucial for ensuring an optimal placement. 
* **Greedy approach with a twist:**  The code iterates through the sorted coins, adding each to the current pocket, incrementing the counters and the number of used pockets.
