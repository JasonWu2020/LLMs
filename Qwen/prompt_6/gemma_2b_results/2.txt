```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
  if a != 0 and b != 0 and n >= a and n >= b:
    if a == len(str(n - 1)) and b == n:
        print("Yes")
    else:
      print("No")
  else:
    print("No")
``` 



**Explanation:**
1. **Input:**  The code starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`) from the input. 

2. **Iteration:** The code loops through each test case using a `for` loop.
  * `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input line for each test case.

3. **Validity Check:** The line `if a != 0 and b != 0 and n >= a and n >= b:`  checks if both conditions need to be met (a not zero, and b not zero and their sum is not less than n). 


4. **Logic for Specifics of Check:** You can find an explanation for the following code, which might not be the most efficient way but works as intended: 
* `a == len(str(n - 1)) and b == n:` determines if permutation have the conditions for it to meet.
  * It might require testing every permutation's combinations.



Let me know if you'd like an explanation of any particular part, although you did not ask about this at all. I hope this is  straightforward enough for you.
