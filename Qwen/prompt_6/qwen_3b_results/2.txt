```python
import sys

# Reading the number of test cases
t = int(input().strip())

for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    
    # If the sum of a and b exceeds n, it's impossible to have both as the prefix and suffix lengths
    if a + b > n:
        print("No")
    else:
        print("Yes")
```
