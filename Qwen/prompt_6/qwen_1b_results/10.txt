```python
from math import gcd

def max_days(a, b):
    # Calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b
    g = gcd(a, b)
    
    # The maximum number of days with different socks
    diff_days = min(a, b) // g
    
    # The remaining socks after forming pairs
    rem_socks = (a + b - g * diff_days) % 2
    
    return [diff_days, rem_socks]

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Print output
print(*max_days(a, b))
```

This Python script reads two numbers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of red and blue socks respectively. It calculates the maximum number of days Vasya can wear different socks using the formula derived from the problem statement. Then it prints the result, where the first value represents the maximum number of days with different socks, and the second value represents the number of days with the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair.
