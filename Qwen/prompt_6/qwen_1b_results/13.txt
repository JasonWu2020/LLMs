```python
import sys

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    # Read the length of the password
    n = int(input())
    
    # Read the password
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the minimum length to infinity
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through all pairs of indices
    for i in range(n-1):
        if a[i] != a[i+1]:
            # Calculate the new length after removing these two elements
            new_length = n - 2
            
            # Update the minimum length
            min_length = min(min_length, new_length)
            
            # If we have already found a shorter length, break out of the loop
            if new_length == min_length:
                break
    
    # Print the result
    print(min_length)
```
This Python script reads the number of test cases, then iterates through each test case to calculate the minimum possible length of the password after applying the given operation. It updates the minimum length whenever it finds a shorter length, ensuring that only the shortest possible length is printed.
