```python3.8
# Read the input values k and r
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize variables to store the minimum number of shovels needed and the total cost
min_shovels_needed = float('inf')
total_cost = 0

# Iterate over possible numbers of shovels to buy
for num_shovels in range(1, k + 1):
    # Calculate the total cost if buying 'num_shovels' shovels
    total_cost += num_shovels * k
    
    # Check if the total cost is less than or equal to the current minimum
    if total_cost <= min_shovels_needed:
        min_shovels_needed = total_cost
        
# Print the result
print(min_shovels_needed)
```
This Python script follows the guidelines provided and reads the inputs `k` and `r`, then iterates through all possible combinations of shovels to find the minimum number needed to cover the total cost with no change.
