# Read the number of test cases from stdin

# Iterate through each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the value of n for the current test case

```
This Python script defines a function `count_interesting_numbers` that calculates how many numbers between 1 and n have the property that their sum of digits is strictly less than the sum of the digits of the next consecutive number. It then reads the number of test cases from standard input, iterates over each test case, and prints out the number of interesting numbers for each case.
