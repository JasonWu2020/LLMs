```python
from typing import List

def min_pockets(n: int, a: List[int]) -> int:
    # Sort the coins based on their values
    a.sort()
    
    # Initialize variables for tracking the last coin type and the current pocket count
    prev_coin_type = None
    current_pocket_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted coins
    for coin_value in a:
        # If the current coin's value matches the previous coin's value (same type), increase the pocket count
        if coin_value == prev_coin_type:
            current_pocket_count += 1
        
        # Update the previous coin type
        prev_coin_type = coin_value
    
    return current_pocket_count

# Read input
n = int(input())
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate and print the result
print(min_pockets(n, coins))
```
This Python script reads the number of coins and their values from standard input, sorts them, and then iterates through them to find the minimum number of pockets required to distribute all coins such that no two coins of the same value are placed together. It outputs the total number of pockets needed.
