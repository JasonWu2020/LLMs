```python
import sys

def find_longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s):
    # Initialize count for each letter
    counts = [0] * k
    max_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Update the count for the current character
        counts[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
        # Check if the current sequence is good
        if len(set(counts)) == 1:
            # Update the maximum length found so far
            max_length = max(max_length, sum(counts))
    
    return max_length

# Read input
input_line = input()
n, k = map(int, input_line.split())
s = input()

# Find the longest good subsequence
result = find_longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s)

# Print the result
print(result)
```
This Python script follows all the guidelines provided, including reading input, processing it according to the requirements, and printing the final solution.
