```python
import sys

def infinity_clock(n, k, arr):
    max_val = max(arr)
    
    for _ in range(k):
        max_val -= arr.pop(0)
        
    return [max_val - i for i in arr]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = infinity_clock(n, k, arr)
        print(result)
```
This Python script solves the problem by simulating the described operations on the array. It reads the inputs (number of test cases, dimensions, values), processes them through the `infinity_clock` function, and prints out the resulting array after performing the specified number of operations.
