[/INST] Here's a Python solution using backtracking and bitmasks to represent the rows occupied by rooks:

```python
import sys

def is_valid(n, board, mask):
    # Check if current arrangement is good
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i):
            for j in range(n):
                if i != j and (mask & (1 << j)):
                    if abs(i - j) == 1 or j - i in [i - 1, i, i + 1]:
                        return False
    return True

def backtrack(n, k, pos, board, mask):
    if k == 0:
        if is_valid(n, board, mask):
            for _ in range(n):
                print("." * n)
                print("R" if mask & (1 << _) else "." for _ in range(n))
            print()
            return

    for i in range(n):
        if not (mask & (1 << i)):
            mask |= 1 << i
            if backtrack(n, k - 1, i + 1, board, mask):
                return
            mask &= ~(1 << i)

for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    board = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    backtrack(n, k, 0, 0, 0)
    if k > n:
        print("-1")
```

This code reads the input, initializes the board and backtracking variables, and then calls the `backtrack` function to find a stable arrangement of rooks. If no stable arrangement is found, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the arrangement for each test case.

Note that this code assumes that the input is read from standard input and that there is no need to print anything before the test cases, as specified in the problem statement. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the input reading and outputting parts accordingly.</s>
