Here's a Python solution that addresses the given problem:

```python
def max_k(n):
    # If n is even, k can be n // 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2
    
    # For odd numbers, calculate k as (n - 1) // 2 + 1
    return (n - 1) // 2 + 1

# Read input
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    
    result = max_k(n)
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Even Numbers**: If `n` is even, the largest number `k` such that \( n \& (n-1) \& (n-2) \& \ldots \& k = 0 \) is half of `n`. This is because every bit pair in binary representation adds up to zero when they are XORed with each other. Hence, we divide `n` by 2 and take the floor division.

2. **Odd Numbers**: If `n` is odd, the calculation changes slightly. We need to subtract one from `n`, perform a bitwise AND with `(n - 1) // 2`, and add 1. This ensures that the final result includes all bits necessary for the AND operation to become zero.

3. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) followed by pairs of integers (`n`). It processes each test case individually using the `max_k` function before printing the result.

This approach efficiently handles both even and odd values of `n` within the specified constraints.
