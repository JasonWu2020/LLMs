To solve this problem, I will use Python 3.8 to implement the decryption algorithm based on the provided rules. The approach involves iterating through the encrypted string `s` and identifying the pattern of additions made to each character before it was added to the final result `a`. 

Here's how the updated solution would look:

```python
def decrypt_string(s):
    """
    Decrypts the given encrypted string s back to its original form.
    
    Parameters:
        s (str): The encrypted string
    
    Returns:
        str: The decrypted string
    """
    # Initialize variables for storing intermediate results
    current = ""
    result = []
    prev_char = None
    
    for char in s:
        if char == 'a':
            current += "aa"
        elif char == 'b':
            current += "bb"
        else:
            # If previous character was 'a', add 'ab' to current
            if prev_char == 'a':
                current += "ab"
            elif prev_char == 'b':
                current += "ba"
            else:
                current += f"{char}{prev_char}"
        
        # Update result with the current state after adding the new character
        result.append(current)
        prev_char = char
        
    return "".join(result)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
for i in range(1, len(data), 2):
    n = int(data[i])
    s = data[i+1]
    print(decrypt_string(s))
```

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Initialization**: We initialize two lists (`current` and `result`) to keep track of our progress while decrypting and another variable `prev_char` to store the last processed character.

2. **Iterate Through String**: For each character in the encrypted string `s`, we check what changes should be made to the current state based on the rules provided:
   - If the character is 'a', append "aa" to `current`.
   - If the character is 'b', append "bb".
   - Otherwise, if the previous character was 'a', append "ab" to `current`.
   - If the previous character was 'b', append "ba".
   - For all other characters, simply concatenate them with their corresponding previous character.

3. **Store Intermediate Results**: After processing each character, we append `current` to `result`.

4. **Final Output**: After processing the entire string `s`, join all elements in `result` together to get the decrypted string and print it.

This solution ensures that each character in the decrypted string corresponds correctly to the encryption rules described in the problem statement.
