Here's how I would approach solving this problem:

### Python Code:
```python
def min_moves_to_divide(a, b):
    # If 'a' is already divisible by 'b', return 0
    if a % b == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the remainder when 'a' is divided by 'b'
    remainder = a % b
    
    # The minimum number of moves needed is equal to the remainder
    return remainder

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input().strip())

for _ in range(t):
    # Read the values of 'a' and 'b'
    a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    
    # Print the result for each test case
    print(min_moves_to_divide(a, b))
```

### Explanation:
- **Function `min_moves_to_divide`** calculates the minimum number of moves required to make `a` divisible by `b`. This is done by checking if `a` is already divisible by `b`, which means no moves are needed (`remainder == 0`). Otherwise, it returns the value of the remainder, which represents the minimum number of moves needed.
  
- **Reading from input**: 
  - We first read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, we read the values of `a` and `b`.
  - We then call our function `min_moves_to_divide` with these inputs and print the result.

This solution efficiently handles all constraints provided, including large numbers up to \(10^9\), ensuring it runs within the specified time limit of \(O(1)\) per test case.
