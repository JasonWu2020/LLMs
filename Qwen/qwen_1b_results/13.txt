Here's an updated Python 3.8 solution:

```python
def min_length_password(n, arr):
    # Initialize variables
    max_sum = -float('inf')
    current_max = -float('inf')

    # Find the maximum sum of any two non-equal adjacent elements
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if arr[i] != arr[i-1] and arr[i] != arr[i+1]:
            current_max += arr[i]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_max)
    
    # If we have found a maximum sum, return its value plus 1
    if max_sum > 0:
        return max_sum + 1
    
    # Otherwise, return the original length minus 1
    else:
        return n - 1

# Read input
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = min_length_password(N, A)
    print(result)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We iterate through the array starting from the second element up to the second-to-last element.
2. For each pair of adjacent elements, we check if they are different and calculate their sum.
3. We keep track of the highest sum encountered during this iteration.
4. After processing all pairs, we check if we've found a maximum sum greater than zero.
   - If yes, it means we can remove at least one pair, so we add 1 to the maximum sum to account for removing one pair and then adding the remaining elements back together.
   - If no, we cannot remove any pairs, so we subtract 1 from the total length of the array.
5. Finally, we print out the resulting length of the password.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum possible length of the password after applying the given operation optimally.
