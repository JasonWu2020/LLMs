To address this problem effectively, we need to understand how the operations affect the array `a`. Each operation involves finding the maximum element in the array (`d`), then replacing each element with its difference from `d`.

Here's a Python implementation that addresses the problem:

```python
def apply_operations(a, k):
    # Initialize the result list with the original values
    result = [x for x in a]
    
    while k > 0:
        max_val = max(result)
        for i in range(len(result)):
            result[i] -= max_val
        
        # Update k if it was greater than zero
        k -= 1
    
    return result

# Read input
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Apply the operations
    final_a = apply_operations(a, k)
    
    # Print the final state of the array
    print(" ".join(map(str, final_a)))
```

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Initialization**: We start by creating a copy of the array `a` and store it in `result`.
2. **Main Loop**:
   - In each iteration, find the maximum value (`max_val`) among the elements of `result`.
   - For each index `i`, subtract `max_val` from the corresponding element in `result`.
   - Decrement `k` by 1.
3. **Return Result**: After the loop completes (or when `k` reaches 0), we have our final array representation.

This approach ensures that we correctly simulate the operations on the array until they reach their limit. The key insight here is to always reduce `k` whenever possible during the process.

This solution efficiently handles large inputs within the constraints provided.
