To address this problem, we need to devise an algorithm that checks whether a given set of \( k \) rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard forms a stable arrangement. If it does, we should return the positions of these rooks; otherwise, we should indicate that no such arrangement exists.

Here's how I would approach solving this problem:

### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Check Feasibility**: First, verify if it's even possible to place \( k \) rooks on the board without violating the stability condition. This involves checking the constraints on \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Generate Possible Positions**: For each position of the first rook, recursively determine if placing additional rooks at other positions results in a stable configuration. 

3. **Recursive Placement Check**: Use backtracking to try different placements while ensuring that no two rooks share the same row or column. A successful placement indicates a stable arrangement.

4. **Return Result**: Once a valid stable arrangement is found, output it as specified. If no such arrangement exists, return `-1`.

### Python Implementation (Updated Solution):

```python
def is_stable(board):
    """
    Checks if the current arrangement of rooks is stable.
    Returns True if the arrangement is stable, False otherwise.
    """
    rows = [False] * len(board)
    cols = [False] * len(board)
    
    def check(r, c):
        nonlocal rows, cols
        
        # Check rows and columns for conflicts
        for i in range(len(board)):
            if r == i or c == i:
                if rows[i] or cols[i]:
                    return False
                rows[i], cols[i] = True, True
    
        # Check diagonals
        for dr, dc in ((r + 1, c + 1), (r - 1, c - 1), (r + 1, c - 1), (r - 1, c + 1)):
            if 0 <= dr < len(board) and 0 <= dc < len(board):
                if board[dr][dc] == 'R':
                    return False
        return True

    def backtrack(i=0):
        if i == len(board):
            return check(0, 0)
        
        for j in range(len(board)):
            if not rows[j] and not cols[j]:
                board[i][j] = 'R'
                if backtrack(i+1):
                    return True
                board[i][j] = '.'
        
        return False

    return backtrack()

def find_stable_arrangement(n, k):
    """
    Finds a stable arrangement of k rooks on an nxn chessboard.
    Returns None if no such arrangement exists.
    """
    if k > n**2 or k < n:
        return None

    board = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if is_stable(board):
            result.append([i+1]*k)
            break

    if not result:
        return -1

    return '\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in result])

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(find_stable_arrangement(n, k))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`is_stable(board)` Function**: This function checks if the current arrangement of rooks is stable by verifying that no two rooks share the same row, column, or diagonal.
   
2. **`find_stable_arrangement(n, k)` Function**: This function generates all possible arrangements of rooks using recursion and backtracking. It starts by trying to place rooks in every cell of the board and uses `is_stable` to check if the current arrangement is stable. If a stable arrangement is found, it returns the corresponding row indices of the rooks. If no stable arrangement is found after exhausting all possibilities, it returns `-1`.
