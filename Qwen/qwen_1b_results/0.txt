To solve this problem efficiently, we need to find the longest subsequence where all characters appear at least as many times as their frequency in the original string \( s \). This involves counting character frequencies and then finding the longest common subsequence with the specified constraints.

Here's a Python 3.8 implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter
import sys

def longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s):
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string s
    char_freq = Counter(s)
    
    # Sort the characters based on their frequency in descending order
    sorted_chars = sorted(char_freq.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    
    max_length = 0
    
    for i in range(k + 1):  # Iterate over the top k characters
        if i < len(sorted_chars):
            current_char, count = sorted_chars[i]
            max_length = max(max_length, count)
        
        # If there are more than one such characters left after sorting,
        # we cannot form a longer sequence because they would not satisfy the constraint
        if i > 0:
            break
        
        # Find the next highest character in reverse order
        while True:
            next_char, _ = sorted_chars[-(i+1)]
            if sorted_chars[-(i+1)][1] <= 0:
                break
            else:
                max_length += sorted_chars[-(i+1)][1]
                sorted_chars[-(i+1)] = (next_char, 0)
    
    return max_length

# Read input
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])

s = data[2].strip()
print(longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s))
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Character Frequency Counting**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each character appears in the string \( s \).
2. **Sorting Characters by Frequency**: The characters are sorted in descending order of their frequency. This helps us prioritize higher-frequency characters when constructing the subsequence.
3. **Finding Maximum Length**: 
   - We iterate through the top \( k \) characters and keep track of the maximum length of the subsequence formed so far.
   - After processing each character, we check if there are enough high-frequency characters available to continue forming the subsequence.
   - If there are no such characters left, we stop further processing.
4. **Adjusting Sequence Length**: When iterating backwards, we adjust the counts of previously processed characters to ensure the constraints are met.

This approach ensures that we find the longest subsequence where the frequency of each character matches or exceeds its frequency in the original string \( s \), thereby fulfilling the requirement for "good" subsequences.
