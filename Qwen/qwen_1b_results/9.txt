To solve this problem in Python 3.8, we need to follow these steps:

1. Read the input values for `n` and then the list of integers `a`.
2. Calculate how many chest, biceps, and back exercises Greg will perform based on the given pattern.
3. Count the occurrences of each type of exercise.
4. Determine which muscle gets the most exercise by comparing counts.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def find_most_exercised_muscle(n, exercises):
    # Initialize counters for each type of exercise
    chest_count = 0
    biceps_count = 0
    back_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the exercises
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        exercise_type = 'chest' if (i - 1) % 3 == 0 else ('biceps' if (i - 1) % 3 == 1 else 'back')
        
        if exercise_type == 'chest':
            chest_count += exercises[i-1]
        elif exercise_type == 'biceps':
            biceps_count += exercises[i-1]
        elif exercise_type == 'back':
            back_count += exercises[i-1]
    
    # Determine which muscle gets the most exercise
    if chest_count > biceps_count and chest_count > back_count:
        return 'chest'
    elif biceps_count > chest_count and biceps_count > back_count:
        return 'biceps'
    else:
        return 'back'

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    n = int(data[0])
    exercises = [int(num) for num in data[1:]]
    
    result = find_most_exercised_muscle(n, exercises)
    print(result)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `chest_count`, `biceps_count`, and `back_count` are initialized to keep track of the total count of each type of exercise performed.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each exercise from 1 to `n`, we calculate its type (`chest`, `biceps`, or `back`) using `(i - 1) % 3`. This gives us the position in the cycle.
   - If the exercise type matches 'chest', we add the corresponding value from `exercises` to `chest_count`.
   - Similarly, if the exercise type matches 'biceps', we add the corresponding value to `biceps_count`.
   - If the exercise type matches 'back', we add the corresponding value to `back_count`.

3. **Result Determination**:
   - After counting all the exercises, we compare the counts of chest, biceps, and back exercises.
   - The muscle with the highest count is determined and returned as the result.

This approach ensures that we correctly interpret the training plan and determine which muscle receives the most exercise based on the given constraints.
