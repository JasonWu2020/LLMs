To address this problem, we need to determine the largest number \( k \) such that performing a bitwise AND on \( n \), \( n-1 \), \( n-2 \), ..., down to \( k \) results in zero. This means \( n \) must be divisible by all numbers from 1 up to \( k \).

Here's how you can approach solving it:

### Algorithm Outline:
1. **Initialization**: Start with `k` set to 1 (the smallest possible value).
2. **Check Divisibility**: For each increment of `k`, check if `n % k == 0`. If true, continue; otherwise, break out since no further values would satisfy the condition.
3. **Return Result**: Once the loop completes without breaking due to divisibility checks, return the current value of `k`.

### Python Implementation:

```python
def max_k(n):
    """
    Finds the maximum value of k such that n & (n-1) & (n-2) & ... & k = 0.
    
    Parameters:
    - n (int): The initial integer.
    
    Returns:
    int: The maximum value of k satisfying the condition.
    """
    k = 1
    while True:
        if n % k != 0:
            break
        k += 1
    return k - 1  # Subtract 1 because the last iteration did not meet the condition

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        result = max_k(n)
        print(result)
```

### Explanation:
- We initialize `k` to 1.
- In each iteration, we check if `n % k` equals 0. If so, we move to the next higher value of `k`.
- The loop continues until we find the point where `n` cannot be divided by any value starting from 1 up to `k`.
- Finally, we subtract 1 from `k` as per the note provided in the problem statement.

This implementation efficiently finds the required `k` using a simple loop and modulo operations. It handles edge cases well, including when `n` itself is a power of two or larger than a reasonable limit.
