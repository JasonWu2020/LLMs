This Python script calculates the minimum time required for the car to travel from point A to point B while considering the traffic light cycle. It first determines whether the car can pass through the traffic lights based on the timing of the light changes. If the car reaches the lights during the red light phase, it waits until the next green light period. Then it calculates the total time required to travel from the traffic lights to point B.

Please note that this script assumes that `d < l` as specified in the problem statement. The function `min_travel_time` returns the minimum time required for the car to travel from point A to point B under the given constraints.
