### Critique of the Provided Solution
The solution correctly checks if the boy can walk infinitely far away from the starting point by exploring all possible paths from the initial position using a breadth-first search (BFS). The BFS ensures that every cell is explored in order, allowing us to determine if there exists an infinite path. If the BFS reaches any boundary or encounters an impassable cell, it returns `True`, indicating the possibility of an infinite walk. 

### Alternative Solution
Here’s another way to solve the problem by leveraging the properties of the tiling and the periodicity of the maze:

```python
def can_walk_infiniter(maze, n, m):
    directions = [(0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]
    visited = set()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if maze[i][j] == 'S':
                start_x, start_y = i, j
                break
    
    def explore(x, y):
        if (x, y) in visited:
            return False
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and maze[nx][ny] != '#' and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                if nx == 0 or nx == n-1 or ny == 0 or ny == m-1:
                    return True
                if explore(nx, ny):
                    return True
        return False
    
    return explore(start_x, start_y)

def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    maze = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    
    if can_walk_infiniter(maze, n, m):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Alternative Solution
This solution uses a recursive function `explore` to check if there is an infinite path from the starting point. The function visits each cell recursively, exploring all four possible directions. If it finds a boundary cell or another cell that hasn’t been visited, it recursively explores further. The key idea here is to leverage the periodic nature of the maze to ensure that if an infinite path exists within one cycle, it will exist in all cycles due to the tiling.

Both solutions should adhere to the given specifications and produce the correct output based on the input.
