```python
def find_route(n, edges, leaves_order):
    def dfs(node, parent, leaves):
        if len(leaves) == 0:
            return True
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor != parent and neighbor not in leaves:
                if dfs(neighbor, node, leaves):
                    result.append(node)
                    result.append(neighbor)
                    leaves.remove(neighbor)
                    return True
        return False
    
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    leaves = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if len(graph[i]) == 1]
    leaves_order = [leaves.index(i) for i in leaves_order]
    result = []
    
    # Check if valid route exists
    if not dfs(1, 0, leaves):
        return -1
    
    # Add root to the end of the route
    result.append(1)
    
    # Reconstruct the route based on the order of leaves
    for i, leaf in enumerate(leaves):
        result.append(leaf)
        result.append(leaves[(i + 1) % len(leaves_order)])
    
    return result

# Read input
n = int(input())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
leaves_order = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find and print the route
print(' '.join(map(str, find_route(n, edges, leaves_order))))
```

This solution reads the input and prints the output as specified. It constructs the graph from the edges, identifies the leaves, and then attempts to construct a valid route by visiting all vertices and leaves in the specified order. If a valid route cannot be found, it returns -1.
