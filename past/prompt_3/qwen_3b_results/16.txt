```python
def check_spit_enclosure(n):
    positions = {}
    
    for _ in range(n):
        x, d = map(int, input().split())
        if x in positions:
            positions[x] += d
        else:
            positions[x] = d
    
    for pos, spit in positions.items():
        if positions.get(pos + spit, 0) > 0:
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

n = int(input())
print(check_spit_enclosure(n))
```

This solution reads the number of camels `n` and their positions and spitting distances from standard input. It then checks if any camel spits at another camel by storing the current position and accumulated spit distance in a dictionary. If it finds a position where another camel has already spit, it prints "YES". Otherwise, after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO". 

Please note that this solution assumes the input format is correct and does not include error handling for invalid inputs.
