```python
def find_route(n, stamps):
    # Initialize a graph using adjacency list representation
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n+1)}
    
    # Build the graph based on the stamps
    for src, dst in stamps:
        graph[src].append(dst)
        graph[dst].append(src)
    
    # Perform DFS to find one of the routes
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    def dfs(node, path):
        if not visited[node]:
            visited[node] = True
            path.append(node)
            if len(path) > 1:
                return path
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                result = dfs(neighbor, path)
                if result:
                    return result
            path.pop()
        return None
    
    # Start DFS from any city
    start_city = 1
    route = dfs(start_city, [])
    
    # If no valid route found, it means there's no valid path in the given graph
    if not route:
        return []
    
    # Return the route with the starting city at the end
    return route + [route[-1]]

# Example usage
n = int(input().strip())
stamps = [list(map(int, input().strip().split())) for _ in range(n)]
print(*find_route(n, stamps))
```

This solution defines a function `find_route` that takes the number of stamps `n` and a list of stamps as inputs. It constructs a graph based on the stamps and performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find one of the possible routes. If a valid route is found, it returns the route along with the starting city at the end. If no valid route is found, it returns an empty list.

Please note that the example usage assumes the input format is as specified. If your input format differs, you may need to adjust the parsing logic accordingly.
