```python
def can_transform(A, B, C):
    ax, ay = A
    bx, by = B
    cx, cy = C

    # Check if we can transform A into B by adding C and rotating
    for _ in range(4):  # 4 rotations cover all possibilities
        if ax == bx and ay == by:
            return "YES"
        ax, ay = -ay, ax  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
        ax += cx
        ay += cy

    return "NO"

# Reading inputs
A = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
B = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
C = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

# Outputting result
print(can_transform(A, B, C))
```

This Python script checks if it's possible to obtain vector `B` from vector `A` by performing the allowed operations (rotating 90 degrees clockwise and adding vector `C`). The function `can_transform` takes vectors `A`, `B`, and `C` as arguments and iterates through four possible rotations to see if vector `A` can be transformed into vector `B`. If at any point the coordinates match, it returns "YES". If no match is found after all rotations, it returns "NO".

Please note that this approach assumes that the input vectors are large enough and that there are no constraints on the number of operations that can be performed. If there are specific constraints or larger data sizes, further optimization might be needed.
