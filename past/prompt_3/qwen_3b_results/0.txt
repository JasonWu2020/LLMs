```python
def longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s):
    freq = [0] * k
    for char in s:
        freq[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    
    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    target_freq = freq[0]
    
    for freq_count in freq:
        if freq_count == target_freq:
            current_length += 1
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            current_length = 1
            target_freq = freq_count
            
    return max(max_length, current_length)

# Reading input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n, k = list(map(int, data[0].split()))
s = data[1]

# Calculating and printing the result
print(longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s))
```

This solution iterates through the string `s` to count the frequency of each character from 'A' to the `k`-th letter. It then calculates the maximum length of a subsequence where all characters have the same frequency. The function `longest_good_subsequence` returns this maximum length.

Please note that the provided code assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that `sys.stdin.read` correctly reads the input as specified. If the input format might vary, additional validation should be added.
