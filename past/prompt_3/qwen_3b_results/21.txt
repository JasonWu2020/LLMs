```python
def max_dominos(a):
    n = len(a)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] >= 2 and a[i + 1] >= 2:
            count += min(a[i], a[i + 1]) // 2
            a[i] -= min(a[i], a[i + 1]) // 2
            a[i + 1] -= min(a[i], a[i + 1]) // 2
        elif a[i] >= 2:
            count += a[i] // 2
            a[i] %= 2
    return count

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(max_dominos(a))
```

This solution reads the length of each column from the input, calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can fit into the histogram, and prints the result. It iterates through the array, checking pairs of columns and using the minimum of the two to place a domino, reducing the column lengths accordingly. The process continues until all columns have been processed.
