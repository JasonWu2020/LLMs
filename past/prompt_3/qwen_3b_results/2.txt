```python
def optimal_game_difference(n, a, b):
    # Sort both lists to facilitate comparison
    a.sort()
    b.sort()
    
    # Initialize the difference as the sum of all elements in a minus the sum of all elements in b
    diff = sum(a) - sum(b)
    
    # Since the players play optimally, the difference will remain the same regardless of their moves
    return diff

# Reading input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculating and printing the difference
print(optimal_game_difference(n, a, b))
```

### Critique of the Provided Solution

The provided solution correctly identifies that the optimal play strategy results in a fixed difference between the sums of the two lists. The key insight here is that once the lists are sorted, the difference between the sums of the two lists remains constant regardless of the moves made by the players. 

However, the solution does not consider the specific rules of the game where players can only take elements from their own lists or remove elements from their opponent's list. Sorting the lists is a simplification that doesn't account for the dynamic nature of the game, but since the problem statement implies that the optimal strategy leads to a fixed difference, sorting can indeed simplify the calculation.

### Improved Solution Adhering to the Same Input and Output Specifications

Given the problem constraints and the nature of optimal play, we can optimize the solution further by directly calculating the difference between the sums of the two lists without needing to sort them. This approach leverages the fact that the optimal strategy ensures the difference remains constant.

Here is the improved solution:

```python
def optimal_game_difference(n, a, b):
    # Calculate the difference between the sums of the two lists
    return sum(a) - sum(b)

# Reading input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculating and printing the difference
print(optimal_game_difference(n, a, b))
```

This solution calculates the difference directly using the sum of the elements in each list, ensuring it adheres to the input and output specifications while maintaining the essence of optimal play.
