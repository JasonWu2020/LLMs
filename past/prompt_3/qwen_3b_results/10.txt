```python
def max_team_height(n, heights_row1, heights_row2):
    # Initialize variables
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    max_height = 0
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            # Calculate the maximum height if the current student is chosen
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + (heights_row1[i - 1] > heights_row2[j - 1])
            # Update the maximum height found so far
            max_height = max(max_height, dp[i][j])
    
    return max_height

# Read input
n = int(input())
heights_row1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
heights_row2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Compute and print the result
print(max_team_height(n, heights_row1, heights_row2))
```

This solution iterates through all possible combinations of choosing students from both rows, keeping track of the maximum height sum possible while adhering to the rules. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute this. 

Please note that due to the large values of `n` (up to \(10^5\)), the solution needs to be optimized further or potentially use a different approach to handle such large inputs efficiently.
