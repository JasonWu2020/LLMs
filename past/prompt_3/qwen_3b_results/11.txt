        if i >= 2:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 2] + max(heights_row1[i - 1], heights_row2[i - 1]))
    return dp[n]

### Critique of the Provided Solution
The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It iterates through possible lengths of the team and keeps track of the maximum height sum achievable with those lengths, considering the constraint that no two consecutive chosen students can be from the same row. However, there is a potential issue with the logic handling the transition between different rows, which may not correctly capture the optimal choices given the constraints.

### Corrected Solution
To ensure the solution adheres to the problem constraints and maximizes the total height of the chosen team, we need to consider the transitions carefully:

1. We initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum height sum of a team of length `i`.
2. For each possible team length, we update the DP array by considering the maximum height sum from the previous state (`dp[i-1]`) and adding the height of the current student from either row, ensuring no consecutive students belong to the same row.

Here's the corrected version of the solution:

```python
def max_team_height(n, heights_row1, heights_row2):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = max(heights_row1[0], heights_row2[0])  # Initialize the base case
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + max(heights_row1[i-1], heights_row2[i-1]))
    
    return dp[n]

n = int(input())
heights_row1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
heights_row2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(max_team_height(n, heights_row1, heights_row2))
```

This solution ensures that it correctly computes the maximum possible total height of players in a team under the given constraints.
