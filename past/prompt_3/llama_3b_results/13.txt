Critique of the outputted solution:

* The solution uses a list `max_idx` to store the indices of the maximum character in each position in the string. This is a good approach, but it can be optimized by only storing the last seen index of each character.
* The solution iterates over the indices from 25 to 0, which is unnecessary. It can be optimized by iterating over the indices from 0 to 25.
* The solution appends a repeated character to the result list, which can be optimized by using a list comprehension to generate the repeated characters.
* The solution does not handle the case where the input string is empty.

Here's an alternative solution that addresses these issues:

```python
def max_subsequence(s):
    if not s:
        return ''

    last_seen = {}
    for c in s:
        last_seen[c] = last_seen.get(c, 0) + 1

    res = []
    for c in sorted(last_seen, reverse=True):
        res.extend([c] * last_seen[c])
    return ''.join(res)

s = input()
print(max_subsequence(s))
```

This solution uses a dictionary `last_seen` to store the count of each character in the string. It then iterates over the characters in descending order, appending the character to the result list as many times as its count. This approach is more efficient and easier to understand.
