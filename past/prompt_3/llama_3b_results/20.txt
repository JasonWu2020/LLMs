**Critique of the original solution:**

The original solution is generally correct, but there are a few issues:

1. The solution does not handle the case where the number of digits in `x` is less than `k`. In this case, the solution will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `a[i-k]`.
2. The solution does not handle the case where `a[0]` is greater than `a[k-1]`. In this case, the solution will append `a[0]` to `b` instead of `a[k-1]`.
3. The solution does not handle the case where `a[k-1]` is greater than `a[0]`. In this case, the solution will not append `a[k-1]` to `b` and will result in an incorrect solution.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    a = list(a)
    b = [a[0]]

    for i in range(1, n):
        if i >= k:
            if a[i] >= a[i-k]:
                b.append(a[i])
            else:
                b.append(a[i-k])
        else:
            b.append(a[i])

    if len(b) < n:
        for _ in range(len(b), n):
            b.append(b[0])

    print(len(b))
    print(''.join(map(str, b)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**

This solution first converts the input string `a` to a list of characters, so that we can modify it in-place. It then initializes `b` with the first digit of `a`.

The solution then iterates over the remaining digits of `a`, starting from the second digit. If the current digit is greater than or equal to the digit `k` positions before it, it appends the current digit to `b`. Otherwise, it appends the digit `k` positions before it.

If the length of `b` is less than `n`, it appends the first digit of `b` to `b` until its length is equal to `n`.

Finally, it prints the length of `b` and the digits of `b` as a string.
