Critique of the outputted solution:

1. The solution uses a mathematical approach to determine if it's possible to get vector B by performing the specified operations on vector A. However, the solution is not very efficient and has some logical errors.

2. The solution uses a lot of repeated calculations and comparisons, which can be avoided.

3. The solution does not handle edge cases properly.

4. The solution does not provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm used.

5. The variable names are not descriptive.

6. The solution uses `math.sqrt` which is not necessary.

7. The solution does not handle the case when vector A is the zero vector.

8. The solution does not handle the case when vector B is the zero vector.
