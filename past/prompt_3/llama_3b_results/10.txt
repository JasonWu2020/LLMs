**Critique of the original solution:**

The original solution is a dynamic programming solution that tries to maximize the total height of the team by considering all possible combinations of students from both rows. However, the solution has some issues:

1.  The solution uses a lot of memory, as it creates a 2D array `dp` of size `(2 * n + 1) * 2`, which is not necessary. This can be optimized by using a 1D array.
2.  The solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large inputs. This can be optimized by using a more efficient dynamic programming approach.
3.  The solution does not handle the case where the maximum height of the team is achieved by choosing students from only one row.

**Improved solution:**

```python
import sys

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_height = 0
curr_height = 0

for i in range(n):
    curr_height += a[i]
    if curr_height > max_height:
        max_height = curr_height
    if i!= n - 1 and curr_height > b[i + 1]:
        curr_height -= a[i]
        curr_height += b[i + 1]

for i in range(n):
    curr_height += b[i]
    if curr_height > max_height:
        max_height = curr_height
    if i!= n - 1 and curr_height > a[i + 1]:
        curr_height -= b[i]
        curr_height += a[i + 1]

print(max_height)
```

**Explanation:**

This solution iterates over each row and tries to maximize the total height of the team by choosing students from both rows. It keeps track of the current total height of the team and updates it whenever a student with a higher height is chosen. If a student with a higher height is chosen from the other row, the current student is removed from the team and the process is repeated. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and uses a constant amount of memory, making it more efficient than the original solution.
