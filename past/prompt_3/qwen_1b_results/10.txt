### Critique of the Provided Solution

Given the provided solution, it seems to focus on choosing students with the highest possible heights while ensuring they are not adjacent to each other across different rows. However, this approach doesn't explicitly account for the constraint that there are only two rows available for selection.

Hereâ€™s an improved solution that addresses these issues:

```python
def max_height_team(n, heights):
    # Sort the heights array to easily pick the highest ones
    sorted_heights = sorted(heights)
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sum and the last selected height
    current_sum = 0
    last_selected_height = -1
    
    # Iterate through the sorted heights
    for height in sorted_heights:
        if last_selected_height != -1 and height <= last_selected_height + 1:
            continue
        
        current_sum += height
        last_selected_height = height
    
    return current_sum

# Read input
n = int(input())
heights_1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
heights_2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the maximum possible total height
max_total_height = max(max_height_team(n, heights_1), max_height_team(n, heights_2))

# Print the result
print(max_total_height)
```

### Explanation of the Improved Solution

1. **Sorting Heights**: We sort the heights of both rows to facilitate easy selection of the highest possible heights.
  
2. **Iterating Through Sorted Heights**: For each height in the sorted list, we check if adding it would violate the condition that no two chosen heights are consecutive within their respective rows. If not, we add the height to our running total (`current_sum`) and update `last_selected_height`.

3. **Handling Consecutive Heights**: By checking for consecutive heights at each step, we ensure that we do not select students who would make a pair of consecutive heights within their own row.

4. **Final Calculation**: After iterating through all heights, we compare the sums obtained from selecting students from either row and return the higher value as the maximum possible total height.

This solution ensures that the chosen students maximize the total height while adhering to the given constraints.
