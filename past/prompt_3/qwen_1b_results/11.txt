### Critique of the Provided Solution:

**Issue with the Current Approach:**

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the heights of both rows separately before combining might not yield the optimal result since it doesn't consider the constraint on choosing students alternately between rows.
  
2. **Greedy Selection Strategy**: Choosing students based on their position (left-to-right) does not necessarily maximize the sum of their heights when alternating between rows. A more sophisticated strategy would be needed.

### Proposed Solution:

To solve this problem efficiently while adhering to the constraints, we need to devise an algorithm that maximizes the sum of heights for a team composed of students chosen in an alternating fashion between rows. One approach could involve sorting the students' positions rather than heights initially, ensuring we alternate choices across rows effectively.

Hereâ€™s how we can implement this idea using Python:

```python
def max_team_height(n, row1, row2):
    # Initialize variables to store the best sum found so far and the current best pair indices
    best_sum = -float('inf')
    best_pair_indices = (-1, -1)
    
    # Iterate over each student in the first row
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of heights if this student was picked
        current_sum = sum(row1[i] + row2[(i+1)%n])
        
        # Update the best sum and corresponding pair indices if this sum is better
        if current_sum > best_sum:
            best_sum = current_sum
            best_pair_indices = (i, (i+1)%n)
    
    return best_sum

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    n = int(data[0])

    row1 = list(map(int, data[1:n*2]))
    row2 = list(map(int, data[n*2:]))

    print(max_team_height(n, row1, row2))
```

This script takes inputs for `n`, followed by two lists representing the heights of students in the first and second rows respectively. It then calculates the maximum possible sum of heights for a team composed of students chosen in an alternating fashion between rows, updating its best solution along the process. This ensures that students are selected optimally based on the given constraints.
