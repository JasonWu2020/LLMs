### Critique of the Provided Solution

The provided Python script reads a string and an integer `k` from standard input, calculates the minimum number of unique characters that can remain after deleting up to `k` characters, and prints the resulting string along with its character count. However, there are a few issues:

- **Input Handling**: The script does not handle cases where `k` exceeds the total number of unique characters in the input string. In such scenarios, the script would incorrectly claim that zero characters remain, which is incorrect since we know there are non-zero characters present even if they were removed entirely.
  
- **Output Format**: The script outputs both the minimum number of unique characters remaining and the resultant string, which may lead to confusion about what constitutes "distinct characters."

### Revised Solution

Below is a revised version of the script that addresses these issues:

```python
from collections import Counter

def min_unique_chars_after_deletion(input_string, k):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of unique characters that can remain in the string
    after deleting up to k characters, and return the resultant string along with this count.
    
    :param input_string: str - The original string containing lowercase Latin letters.
    :param k: int - Maximum number of characters allowed to be deleted.
    :return: tuple - A tuple containing two elements:
                    1) Minimum number of unique characters remaining.
                    2) Resultant string with exactly m distinct characters.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string
    char_count = Counter(input_string)
    
    # Sort the dictionary based on values (frequency) in descending order
    sorted_char_count = dict(sorted(char_count.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True))
    
    # Initialize variables for tracking the maximum deletion capacity and resultant string
    max_deletions = 0
    result_string = ""
    
    for char, freq in sorted_char_count.items():
        # Update deletions and construct the result string while keeping track of remaining deletions
        current_deletions = min(freq, k - max_deletions)
        max_deletions += current_deletions
        
        # Append characters to the result string until we reach the desired number of unique characters
        while len(result_string) < len(input_string) and current_deletions > 0:
            result_string += char
            current_deletions -= 1
    
    return len(result_string), result_string

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    k = int(input().strip())

    m, result_string = min_unique_chars_after_deletion(s, k)
    print(m)
    print(result_string)
```

### Explanation

1. **Character Frequency Calculation**:
   - We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to calculate the frequency of each character in the input string.

2. **Sorting Characters**:
   - We sort the characters by their frequencies in descending order. This allows us to remove the most frequent characters first, minimizing the overall number of unique characters needed.

3. **Deletion Process**:
   - For each character, we determine how many times it needs to be deleted (`min(freq, k - max_deletions)`).
   - We update the maximum deletions made so far and append characters to our result string accordingly.
   - We continue appending characters until we either run out of characters or reach the desired number of unique characters (`len(result_string) < len(input_string)`).

4. **Result Output**:
   - Finally, we print the minimum number of unique characters remaining and the resultant string.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the constraints and accurately determine the minimum number of unique characters that can remain after deleting up to `k` characters.
