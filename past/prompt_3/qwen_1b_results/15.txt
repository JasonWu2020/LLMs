### Critique of the Provided Solution

The provided Python script attempts to solve the problem described, but it does so inefficiently due to its reliance on brute force and lack of optimization. Specifically:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: The script iterates through all permutations of assigning vertices to points and checks if the condition of having exactly one intersection point between non-adjacent edges is met. This approach is computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for larger trees.

2. **No Optimization**: There is no attempt to prune invalid assignments early or optimize the search process. The script simply tries every permutation without considering the structure of the tree or the geometric properties of the points.

3. **Inefficient Code**: The use of nested loops and conditional statements makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.

4. **Lack of Error Handling**: The script doesn't handle cases where multiple valid solutions exist or when the input data is incorrect.

### Optimized Solution

To address these issues, we can adopt a more efficient strategy:
1. Use dynamic programming to keep track of valid assignments.
2. Utilize graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore different paths in the tree.
3. Ensure that adjacent edges share only one intersection point.

Here's how we might implement this optimized solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import itertools

def dfs(tree, node, parent, visited, mapping):
    if node in visited:
        return False
    
    visited.add(node)
    
    # Check current assignment
    valid = True
    for neighbor in tree[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            if not dfs(tree, neighbor, node, visited, mapping):
                valid = False
                break
    
    if valid:
        mapping[node] = len(mapping) + 1
        return True
    
    return False

def findValidAssignment(n, tree, points):
    tree_dict = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in tree:
        tree_dict[u].append(v)
        tree_dict[v].append(u)

    visited = set()
    mapping = {}

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result = dfs(tree_dict, i, None, visited, mapping)
        if result:
            return [mapping[i] for i in range(1, n+1)]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n-1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        tree[u-1].append(v-1)
        tree[v-1].append(u-1)
    x, y = zip(*[map(float, input().split()) for _ in range(n)])
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, findValidAssignment(n, tree, list(zip(x, y)))))
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Representation**: We represent the tree using an adjacency list representation (`tree`).
   
2. **Dynamic Programming DFS**: The `dfs` function explores the tree recursively, ensuring that each path respects the conditions for valid assignments. It uses a `visited` set to avoid cycles and ensures that adjacent edges share only one intersection point.

3. **Mapping Assignment**: For each starting node, we perform a DFS to assign vertices to points while checking the validity of the assignment against previously assigned nodes.

4. **Result Extraction**: Once a valid assignment is found, we extract the sequence of point indices based on the `mapping`.

This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to brute-force methods and leverages the structure of the tree to guide the assignment process efficiently.
