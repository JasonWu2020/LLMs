Solution:
```python
import collections
from functools import reduce

def count_subsequences(s):
    freq = [collections.Counter(c)[chr(i)] for i in range(97, 97 + min(k, len(set(s))))]
    return max([reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, freq[i:i+k]) for i in range(len(freq[0]))])

# Read input
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

# Calculate result
result = count_subsequences(s)
print(result)
```

This Python script takes an input string `s` consisting of the first `k` letters of the Latin alphabet. It counts the occurrences of each letter in the string using a Counter object from the collections module. Then it calculates the product of frequencies of all letters within every possible substring of length `k`, returning the maximum value.

To improve this solution, we could use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid recalculating products for substrings. However, since the constraints are relatively small (up to \(10^5\) characters), the brute-force approach should still work efficiently. The current implementation runs in O(n * k) time complexity, making it suitable for the given problem size.
