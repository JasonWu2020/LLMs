**Critique of the original solution:**

The solution is clear and easy to understand, but it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. This makes it inefficient for large inputs.

**Another solution:**

```python
from collections import Counter

def solve(s, k):
    n = len(s)
    a = [0] * 27
    for c in s:
        a[ord(c) - 65] += 1

    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            if a[j - 1] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + 1)

    return dp[n]

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
print(solve(s, k))
```

**Explanation:**

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first counts the frequency of each character in the input string. Then it creates a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest good subsequence ending at index `i`. The solution iterates over the input string and for each position, it checks all previous positions where the frequency of the current character is less than or equal to the current position. If the frequency is 0, it means that the current character is not present in the input string, so the length of the good subsequence ending at the current position is set to the maximum of its current value and the length of the good subsequence ending at the previous position plus 1. If the frequency is greater than 0, the length of the good subsequence ending at the current position is set to the maximum of its current value and the length of the good subsequence ending at the previous position plus 1.

**Note:** The solution assumes that the input string `s` only contains uppercase letters from 'A' to 'K'. If the input string can contain other characters, additional error checking should be added.
