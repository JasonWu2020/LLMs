The given solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. This can be optimized by using dynamic programming to store the maximum number of dominos that can be drawn up to each column.

Here's the critique:

1. The solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not optimal for large inputs.
2. The solution does not handle the case when the input list is empty.
3. The solution does not handle the case when the input list has only one element.

Here's the optimized solution:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1] + a[i - 1], dp[i - 1])
    print(dp[-1] - 1)

main()
```

This solution works by initializing the first element of the dp array to the first element of the input list. Then it iterates over the rest of the list, updating the dp array by taking the maximum of the current element plus the previous element and the previous element itself. The last element of the dp array is the maximum number of dominos that can be drawn, which is the last element minus one.
