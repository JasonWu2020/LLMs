Critique:

1. The code does not handle the case when `n` is 1 or 2. It should print "No" in both cases.
2. The code does not handle the case when `n` is odd. In this case, it should print "No".
3. The code does not handle the case when `n` is greater than 45,000. It should print "No" in this case.
4. The code does not handle the case when `n` is less than 1. It should print "No" in this case.
5. The code does not handle the case when `n` is not an integer. It should raise a TypeError.
6. The code does not handle the case when `n` is a negative number. It should raise a ValueError.
7. The code does not handle the case when `n` is a non-integer or non-numeric input. It should raise a ValueError.
8. The code does not handle the case when `n` is a very large number and the sum of elements in `n` is greater than the sum of the sizes of the two sets.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math
import sys

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def partition(n):
    if n < 1 or n > 45_000:
        return "No"
    if n % 2:
        return "No"
    if n == 1:
        return "Yes\n1\n"
    sums = [1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        sums.append(sums[-1] + i)
    sums = set(sums)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i not in sums:
            return "No"
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i in sums:
            sums.remove(i)
            print(f"{i} {list(sums)")
            sums = [i] + sums
    return "Yes\n" + " ".join(map(str, sums))

print(partition(int(input())))
```

This code first checks if `n` is valid, then it generates all possible partitions of the numbers from 1 to `n`. It checks each partition to see if it meets the conditions, and if not, it prints "No". If it finds a valid partition, it prints "Yes" followed by the elements of the partition.
