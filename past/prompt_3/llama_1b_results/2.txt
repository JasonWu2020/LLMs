The provided solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, which is not efficient for large inputs. We can improve this by using a hash map to store the frequency of each number in both lists, and then calculate the maximum score that can be achieved.

Here's the improved solution:

```python
import bisect

def get_score(a, b):
    n = len(a)
    a = sorted(set(a))
    b = sorted(set(b))
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i + 1] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + a[i] - b[i])
        dp[i + 1] = max(dp[i + 1], dp[i] + a[i] - b[i])
    return dp[n]

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(get_score(a, b))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n), making it more efficient for large inputs.
