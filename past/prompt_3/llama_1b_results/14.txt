**Critique of the original solution**

The original solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n and m are the dimensions of the maze. This is because it needs to iterate over each cell in the maze to find the starting point and perform DFS from that point. The space complexity is also O(n*m) due to the recursive call stack.

The solution is not very efficient for large inputs because it performs many redundant DFS checks. It checks all four neighboring cells for each cell, which results in a lot of unnecessary work.

**Improved solution**

```python
def can_walk(n, m, grid):
    s = grid.index('S')
    dx = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
    dy = [0, 1, 0, -1]

    def dfs(x, y):
        if x < 0 or x >= n or y < 0 or y >= m or grid[x][y] == '#':
            return False
        if grid[x][y] == 'S':
            return True
        grid[x][y] = '.'
        for i in range(4):
            if dfs(x + dx[i], y + dy[i]):
                return True
        return False

    return dfs(s, 0)

n, m = map(int, input().split())
grid = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
print("Yes" if can_walk(n, m, grid) else "No")
```

**Explanation**

The improved solution uses a more efficient approach by only checking the four neighboring cells for each cell in the maze. It also uses a helper function `dfs` to perform the DFS from the starting point. The `dfs` function returns `True` if the boy can walk to the next cell, and `False` otherwise.

The main `can_walk` function iterates over the maze and calls `dfs` for each cell. It keeps track of the current cell as the starting point and marks it as visited by changing it to '.'. If it finds a cell that is passable and can be reached from the current cell, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), and the space complexity is also O(n*m) due to the recursive call stack.
