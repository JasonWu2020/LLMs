**Critique of the original solution:**

1. The solution is a simple and straightforward implementation of the problem. It reads the input, calculates the initial sum of the array, and then iteratively applies the operation to minimize the sum while not exceeding the given limit.

However, there are a few issues:

1. The solution does not handle edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or contains only one element.
2. The solution modifies the input array in place, which may not be desirable in some cases.
3. The solution does not consider the case where the minimum possible total sum is already achieved without any operation.

**New solution:**

```python
def solve():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 1:
        print(a[0])
        return
    ans = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans += a[i]
    if k >= 1:
        ans += a[0]
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        ans += a[i]
    if k >= 2:
        ans += a[-1]
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```

**Explanation:**

1. The new solution first checks if the input array has only one element. If so, it prints the element and returns.
2. The solution initializes the answer `ans` to the sum of the first element of the array.
3. It then iterates over the array from the second element to the second last element, adding each element to `ans`.
4. If the number of operations `k` is greater than or equal to 1, it adds the first element of the array to `ans`.
5. If the number of operations `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it adds the last element of the array to `ans`.
6. Finally, it prints the final value of `ans`.

This solution has the same time complexity as the original solution, but it handles edge cases and avoids modifying the input array in place.
