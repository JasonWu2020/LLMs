The outputted solution is correct in terms of time calculation, but there are some improvements that can be made.

The issue is that the solution does not consider the case when the car passes the traffic lights at the green light. In this case, the car should be at the traffic lights for the duration of the green light, not just the duration of the green light. Therefore, the corrected solution should be:

```python
l,d,v,g,r = map(int,input().split())
t = d/(v*2*g+r)
t1 = t + (d/(v*2*g))
print(max(t,t1))
```

This solution will correctly calculate the time when the car passes the traffic lights at the green light.

Here is the complete corrected code:

```python
l,d,v,g,r = map(int,input().split())
t = d/(v*2*g+r)
t1 = t + (d/(v*2*g))
print(max(t,t1))
```
