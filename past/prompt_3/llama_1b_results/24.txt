The given code attempts to solve the problem by using a brute force approach. It iterates through all possible combinations of rotations and additions of the two input vectors, and checks if the resulting vector is equal to vector B. However, this approach is inefficient and does not take advantage of the properties of vector operations.

Here's a revised solution that uses a more efficient approach:

```python
import itertools

def rotate_vector(vector, angle):
    x, y = vector
    return x * (1 if angle % 90 == 0 else -1), y * (1 if angle % 90 == 0 else -1)

def is_vector_equal(vector1, vector2):
    return vector1 == vector2

def main():
    vector1 = tuple(map(int, input().split())
    vector2 = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    vector3 = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

    for rotation in itertools.product([-1, 1], repeat=3):
        for add in itertools.product([-1, 1], repeat=2):
            rotated_vector = (vector1[0] + rotation[0] * add[0], vector1[1] + rotation[1] * add[1])
            if is_vector_equal(rotated_vector, vector2):
                print("YES")
                return

main()
```

This solution uses the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of rotations and additions of the two input vectors. The `rotate_vector` function performs the rotation, and the `is_vector_equal` function checks if the resulting vector is equal to vector B. The `main` function reads the input vectors and calls the above functions in a loop, printing "YES" if the resulting vector is equal to vector B.
