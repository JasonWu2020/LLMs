The outputted solution has several issues:

1.  It does not handle the case where `n` is even but the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n` is odd. In this case, it prints "No" which is incorrect because we can still partition the numbers into two sets such that the sum of each set is odd.

2.  It does not handle the case where `n` is odd. The solution assumes that we can always partition the numbers into two sets such that the sum of each set is 1, which is not always true.

Here is another solution that addresses these issues:

```python
n = int(input())
if n % 2 == 1:
    print('No')
else:
    odd = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 2 == 1]
    even = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 2 == 0]
    if sum(odd) > sum(even):
        print('Yes')
        print(len(even) +'' +''.join(map(str, even)))
        print(len(odd) +'' +''.join(map(str, odd)))
    elif sum(even) > sum(odd):
        print('Yes')
        print(len(odd) +'' +''.join(map(str, odd)))
        print(len(even) +'' +''.join(map(str, even)))
    else:
        print('No')
```
