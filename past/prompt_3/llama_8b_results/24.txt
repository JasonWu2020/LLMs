The outputted solution has several issues:

1. It has a lot of repeated code and can be simplified.
2. It does not handle the case when the absolute values of x1 or y1 exceed 10^8 after adding x3 and y3.
3. It does not handle the case when the input vectors are equal.
4. It does not handle the case when the input vector B can be obtained by rotating the vector A by 90 degrees clockwise and then adding a multiple of vector C.

Here is another solution:

```python
x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())

def rotate(x, y):
    return -y, x

def add(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return x1 + x2, y1 + y2

def is_equal(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return x1 == x2 and y1 == y2

for _ in range(4):
    if is_equal(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        print("YES")
        break
    x1, y1 = rotate(x1, y1)
    x1, y1 = add(x1, y1, x3, y3)
    if abs(x1) > 10**8 or abs(y1) > 10**8:
        print("NO")
        break
else:
    print("NO")
```

This solution is more concise and easier to understand. It uses functions to rotate and add vectors, and it handles all the cases mentioned above.
