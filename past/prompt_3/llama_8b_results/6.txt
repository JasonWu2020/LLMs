The outputted solution has a few issues:

1. It's trying to solve the problem by repeatedly finding the minimum values to the left and right of each element, but this approach is not correct. This is because it's not considering the actual problem statement which involves replacing an element with its neighbor's value.

2. The solution is also not efficient as it's performing unnecessary operations.

3. The solution is also not handling the case when k is 0 separately.

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] + a
    a.sort()
    ans = sum(a)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if k >= i - 1:
            ans -= a[i] - a[i - 1]
            k -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    print(ans)
```

This solution sorts the array first, then tries to replace as many elements as possible with the previous smallest element. It stops when k is not enough to replace any more elements. This approach ensures that the total sum of the array is minimized.
