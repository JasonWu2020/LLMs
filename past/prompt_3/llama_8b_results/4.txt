The outputted solution has a few issues:

1. It uses a generator expression inside another generator expression, which might be inefficient for large inputs. Although the problem constraints state that n will not exceed 50, it's still a good practice to avoid such nested generator expressions.
2. The solution assumes that the input is well-formed, i.e., all p_i are distinct and between 1 and n. While this is stated in the problem, it's still a good practice to add some error checking code to handle potential edge cases.
3. The solution uses the variable name'm' for the number of friends, which is not very descriptive. It would be better to use a more descriptive name like 'n' or 'num_friends'.

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    num_friends = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [i+1 for i in p]
    visited = set()
    min_invitations = float('inf')
    for i in range(num_friends):
        if i+1 not in visited:
            visited.add(i+1)
            visited.add(p[i])
            min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
    print(min_invitations if min_invitations!= float('inf') else num_friends)
```

This solution has the same time complexity as the original solution (O(n)), but it avoids nested generator expressions and uses more descriptive variable names. It also adds some error checking code to handle the case where no friends come to the party.
