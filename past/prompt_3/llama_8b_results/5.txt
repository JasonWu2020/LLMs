The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the string. It iterates over the string only once, maintaining a running total of the number of '1's that have appeared before the current index.

However, the solution assumes that the string can be sorted in a single operation by shifting the entire string, which is not always the case. The solution only considers the cost of shifting the substring to the right of the last '1' encountered so far.

A more accurate solution would be to find the longest prefix of the string that is a prefix of the sorted string and then calculate the cost of shifting the remaining part of the string.

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    cost = 0
    while i < n and s[i] == '0':
        i += 1
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j] == '0':
        j += 1
    if j == n:
        print(0)
        continue
    for k in range(j, n):
        if s[k] == '1':
            cost += max(0, k - i)
            i = k + 1
    print(cost)
```

This solution has the same time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), but it accurately calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.
