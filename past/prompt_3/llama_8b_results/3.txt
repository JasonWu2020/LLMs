The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the sorting operation inside the loop. This is inefficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution can be achieved by sorting the array once and then iterating through it to find the optimal sequence of operations.

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = sorted([(x, i) for i, x in enumerate(a)])
ans = -10**18
for i in range(n):
    if s[i][0] < 0:
        continue
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j][0] < 0:
        j += 1
    if j == n:
        break
    ans = max(ans, s[j][0] - s[i][0])
    s[j][0] -= s[i][0]
    s[i] = s[j]
s.sort()
print(max(ans, s[-1][0]))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and then O(n) for the subsequent operations, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n log n).
