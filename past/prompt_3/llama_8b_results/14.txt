The outputted solution has several issues:

1. The solution is not well-structured and is a mix of different concepts. It first removes the '#' characters from the grid, then checks for an infinite path in all eight directions, and finally checks for diagonal paths. This makes the code hard to read and understand.

2. The solution uses a lot of repeated code. For example, the check function is called multiple times with different parameters.

3. The solution uses a lot of global variables. This can make the code harder to understand and debug.

4. The solution does not handle the case where the start position is at the edge of the grid. In this case, the solution should also check the adjacent cells.

Here is a revised solution:

```python
import sys

def check_path(grid, n, m, sx, sy, dx, dy):
    x, y = sx + dx, sy + dy
    if x < 0 or x >= n or y < 0 or y >= m:
        return False
    if grid[x % n][y % m] == '#':
        return False
    return True

n, m = map(int, input().split())
grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]

sx, sy = -1, -1
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] == 'S':
            sx, sy = i, j
            break

for dx in range(-1, 2):
    for dy in range(-1, 2):
        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
            continue
        if check_path(grid, n, m, sx, sy, dx, dy) and check_path(grid, n, m, sx, sy, -dx, -dy):
            print('Yes')
            sys.exit()

print('No')
```

This solution is more structured and efficient. It uses a helper function to check if a path exists in a certain direction. It also eliminates the need for global variables and repeated code.
