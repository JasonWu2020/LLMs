The outputted solution has some issues:

1.  The solution does not handle the case when a point has the same coordinates as another point. This could potentially lead to incorrect results if two points have the same coordinates but are in different positions in the list `p`.

2.  The solution does not handle the case when there are multiple points with the same coordinates. In this case, the solution will assign the same number to multiple points.

3.  The solution does not handle the case when the points are not sorted in any particular order. The solution assumes that the points are in the order of their appearance in the input, but this is not specified in the problem statement.

4.  The solution does not handle the case when the maximum degree of a vertex is greater than 2. In this case, the solution will not work correctly.

5.  The solution does not handle the case when the graph is not connected. In this case, the solution will not work correctly.

Here is another solution that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys
from collections import deque, defaultdict

n = int(input())
G = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
for _ in range(n-1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    G[u].append(v)
    G[v].append(u)
p = [(x, y) for x, y in (map(int, input().split()) for _ in range(n))]
d = [0] * (n+1)
q = deque()
q.append(1)
d[1] = 1
while q:
    u = q.popleft()
    for v in G[u]:
        if d[v] == 0:
            d[v] = d[u] + 1
            q.append(v)
m = max(d)
m += 1
G = [[] for _ in range(m)]
for i in range(n):
    x, y = p[i]
    d = d[i+1]
    G[d].append((x, y))
    G[d+1].append((x, y))
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(1, m+1):
    if len(G[i]) >= 2:
        for j in range(len(G[i]) - 1):
            ans[p.index((G[i][j][0], G[i][j][1]))] = i
        ans[p.index((G[i][-1][0], G[i][-1][1]))] = i
    else:
        ans[p.index((G[i][0][0], G[i][0][1]))] = i
print(*[i for i in ans[1:]])
```

However, this solution still has some issues. It does not handle the case when there are multiple points with the same coordinates. To fix this, we need to use a more sophisticated approach to assign numbers to points.

Here is another solution that uses a more sophisticated approach:

```python
import sys
from collections import deque, defaultdict

n = int(input())
G = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
for _ in range(n-1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    G[u].append(v)
    G[v].append(u)
p = [(x, y) for x, y in (map(int, input().split()) for _ in range(n))]
d = [0] * (n+1)
q = deque()
q.append(1)
d[1] = 1
while q:
    u = q.popleft()
    for v in G[u]:
        if d[v] == 0:
            d[v] = d[u] + 1
            q.append(v)
m = max(d)
m += 1
G = [[] for _ in range(m)]
for i in range(n):
    x, y = p[i]
    d = d[i+1]
    G[d].append((x, y))
    G[d+1].append((x, y))
points = sorted(set(p))
points.sort()
m = len(points)
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(1, m+1):
    x, y = points[i-1]
    for j in range(n):
        if p[j] == (x, y):
            ans[j] = i
            break
print(*[i for i in ans[1:]])
```

This solution first sorts the points by their coordinates and then assigns numbers to points in this sorted order. This ensures that points with the same coordinates will have the same number.
