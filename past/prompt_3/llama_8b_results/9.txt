The outputted solution is correct but could be improved for readability and robustness. 

The main issue with the current solution is that it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format, with exactly two integers separated by a space. If the input is not in this format, the solution will fail. 

Here's an alternative solution that handles potential input errors:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
if len([n, k])!= 2:
    print("Invalid input: Expected two numbers separated by a space.")
else:
    n -= 1
    k -= 1
    print(n - (k + 1) // 2)
```

However, a more robust solution would be to use a try-except block to handle potential errors:

```python
try:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    n -= 1
    k -= 1
    print(n - (k + 1) // 2)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input: Expected two numbers separated by a space.")
```

As for the problem itself, the solution can be simplified further by using a mathematical approach. 

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(n - (k + 1) // 2)
```

This solution achieves the same result as the original solution but with less code. The mathematical approach is based on the fact that the number of candies eaten is equal to the total number of moves minus the number of moves where candies were added, which is (k + 1) // 2.
