The outputted solution is generally correct, but it can be improved for better performance and readability. 

Here are some potential issues with the solution:

1. The solution uses a single variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum character seen so far, which might lead to incorrect results if the maximum character appears multiple times in the string. However, in this case, since the string consists of only lowercase English letters, it's guaranteed that each character can appear at most once in the maximum subsequence.

2. The solution uses a list `ans` to store the characters of the maximum subsequence. This might lead to unnecessary memory usage if the string is very large. However, since the maximum subsequence is guaranteed to be at most the length of the original string, this is not a significant concern.

3. The solution uses the `ord` function to compare the ASCII values of characters, which is not the most Pythonic way to compare characters. However, this is not a significant issue.

4. The solution uses a list comprehension to reverse the list `ans` before joining it into a string, which is not necessary. It's better to use a regular for loop to build the string in the correct order.

Here's an alternative solution that addresses these issues:

```python
s = input()
ans = []
mx = 0
for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
    if ord(s[i]) > mx:
        ans.append(s[i])
        mx = ord(s[i])
    elif len(ans) == 0 or ord(s[i]) > ord(ans[-1]):
        ans.append(s[i])
ans = ans[::-1]
print(''.join(ans))
```

However, a more efficient solution would be to use a two-pointer approach, where we maintain two pointers `i` and `j` pointing to the current character and the last character in the maximum subsequence respectively. We move `i` to the left and update `j` if we find a character that is greater than the character at `j`. This way, we avoid the need to reverse the list and join it into a string.

```python
s = input()
i, j = len(s) - 1, len(s) - 1
ans = []
while i >= 0:
    if ord(s[i]) > ord(s[j]):
        ans.append(s[i])
        j = i
    i -= 1
print(''.join(ans))
```
