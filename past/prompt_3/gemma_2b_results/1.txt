## Critique of the Outputted Solution

The provided solution is functional but not optimal. 

* **Lack of Optimality**: The logic in `is_possible` is linear, and the solutions only check for existence of a valid partition. The solution could be made more efficient by using a data structure for efficient set tracking within the loop.
* **Overly Simplistic**: The solution checks the GCD of the sums but misses opportunities to exploit additional properties of the input for improvement, such as recognizing certain ranges are easier to partition due to factors like divisors and prime numbers.


## New Solution:

```python
def is_possible(n):
    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, n): 
            if gcd(i, j) > 1 and dp[j - 1][i - 1] == 1:
                dp[i][n] = True
    return dp[n][n]
    
def gcd(a, b):
  while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
  return a  

n = int(input())
if is_possible(n) :
  print("Yes")
  for i in range(1, n+1):
    print(f"  Set 1: {set(range(1, i+1))}") 
  for i in range(i+1, n+1):
    print(f"  Set 2: {set(range(i, n+1))}")
else:
  print("No") 
```


**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Utilizes a 2D dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is initialized as `1` if `gcd(i, j) > 1` and  `dp[j - 1][i - 1]` is `1` and returns `True`. 
2. **Simplified Output**: Offers a clear and concise way to display the partitions with each valid partition. 


**Additional Notes**

* This new solution uses `dp` to prevent redundant calculations and offers greater speed. 
* It leverages the GCD relationship between sets for a better understanding of the problem's nature and simplifies the logic.
