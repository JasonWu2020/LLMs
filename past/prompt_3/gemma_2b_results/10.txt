<start_of_turn>model
The provided solution has a small flaw: it doesn't correctly consider the cumulative effect of selecting students from the two rows. As a result, even though it's intended to find the maximum total height of players in a team, it won't always give the optimal solution. 


**Here's a corrected and improved solution:**

```python
def solution():
    n = int(input())
    h1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_height = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1):
            max_height = max(max_height, max(h1[i], h2[(i+j+1) % n]))
    return max_height

print(solution())
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Double Loop for Selection**: The code now utilizes nested loops. The outer loop iterates through each row of students (`i`), while the inner loop iterates from `i+1` to efficiently avoid selecting consecutive students in the same row.


* **Maximization with modulo:** We utilize a modulo operator to cleverly select the index of the next student.


**How It  Works**

1. **Input:** The input is read, including the student count, and the heights of students for each row.

2. **Initialization:** `max_height` is initialized to 0 to store the maximum height found so far.

3. **Iteration:** The nested loop systematically constructs teams, evaluating the heights from the different rows.


With this implementation, the code effectively iterates through all possible combinations of students and calculates the maximum height for every team, optimizing the approach to find the maximum height of a team.
