You are absolutely correct! The provided solution is a good start and does a decent job. Here's a breakdown and some improvements:

**Critique:**


* **Clarity:** The code is relatively clear in terms of logic. However,  it could be made more explicit in terms of the algorithm it's using. The `invitations` set is a great idea to track who can come.

* **Performance:** This approach has a time complexity of O(n), but for the limited set of values, this would be more efficiently handled with a brute-force approach of checking each set of friends.

## Improved Solution:


```python
def min_invitations(n, p):
  invitations = set()
  for i in range(n):
    invitations.add(p[i])

  return len(invitations)


t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  n, p = map(int, input().split())
  print(min_invitations(n, p))
```

I removed the conditional statement for the friends coming case from the provided solution as it is not the best approach to handling the scenario. 



**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Direct Set Manipulation:** The code is slightly clearer, using a loop to directly generate the invitations set and then returning the length of that set.


**Key Points:**

* **Input:** The input in this improved solution is still as defined in the prompt. The code then uses its input to determine the solution.
* **Output:** The output is a single integer that represents the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends are invited, which is the desired information. 

Let me know if you would like to explore additional optimization techniques or more complex input scenarios!
