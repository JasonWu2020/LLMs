### Critique of the Initial Solution:

1. **Function `can_transform_vector`** - This function correctly takes three inputs, performs rotation and addition operations on vector `A`, and checks whether it becomes equal to vector `B`. However, the rotations are limited to only four iterations (`for _ in range(4)`), which might not always cover all possible transformations since the sequence and number of operations required can be arbitrary.

2. **Rotation Function** - The `rotate_90_clockwise` function rotates a vector by 90 degrees clockwise, but this function should take into account the order of dimensions. It should use `(x, y)` order and produce a result based on that. Also, the method is limited to rotations within one axis plane; 3D transformations would require a different approach.

3. **Transformation Execution** - It's trying to check for a transformation to match either `B` or its 90-degree rotation after each operation. This strategy might not work efficiently for finding the right combination of transformations especially when dealing with complex operations like additions.

### Alternative Solution:

#### Approach:

- **Represent Vector Operations**: Convert the problem into an algebraic equation by representing the original vector, target vector, and the addend vector using linear combinations.
  
- **Find a Linear Combination**: Solve the system of linear equations where one vector is represented as a linear combination of others, possibly including rotations and additions.

### Python Code:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def transform_vectors(A, B, C):
    # Define symbolic variables
    x, y, a, b, c = symbols('x y a b c')

    # Equations representing the transformations
    eq1 = Eq(a*x + c*y, B[0])
    eq2 = Eq(a*y - c*x, B[1])
    eq3 = Eq(a, A[0])
    eq4 = Eq(b, A[1])

    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4), (a, b, c))

    return 'YES' if solution else 'NO'

# Reading input from stdin
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Output solution to stdout
print(transform_vectors(A, B, C))
```

### Explanation:

This alternative solution formulates the problem as solving a system of linear equations rather than performing brute-force rotations and additions. It assumes the ability to represent any vector transformation using linear algebra, which is generally true given enough operations and steps.

It's a more efficient and theoretically sound approach, but it assumes that the operations can be represented accurately through linear combinations, which might not hold in specific edge cases or under unconventional operations not strictly detailed in the original problem statement.
