### Critique of the initial solution

**Correctness:** The solution correctly calculates the minimum number of invitations required for at least two friends to attend the party based on the problem constraints and given input format.

**Efficiency:** The solution iterates through each friend twice, which results in O(n) time complexity where n is the number of friends. The additional operation of maintaining a set `s` and counting its size gives it O(n) space complexity in the worst-case scenario.

**Readability:** The code is understandable, with clear comments and variable names.

**Best practices adherence:** Good practice includes following PEP8 style guidelines for Python, having a single function to solve the problem, and using a for-loop instead of an if-statement when iterating over the input data structure. 

**Potential improvements:** One potential improvement could be the optimization of finding friends who need an invitation to attend, aiming for a more efficient approach potentially with a single pass through the array if possible.

### New Solution
```python
def min_invitations_needed(n, p):
    """Function to calculate the minimum number of invitations required"""
    visited_friends = set()
    for friend_id in range(n):
        if friend_id not in visited_friends:
            stack = [friend_id]
            while stack:
                current_friend = stack.pop()
                if current_friend in visited_friends:
                    continue
                visited_friends.add(current_friend)
                best_friend = p[current_friend]
                if best_friend not in visited_friends:
                    stack.append(best_friend)
    return len(visited_friends) - 1

# Reading input from stdin
n_test_cases = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(n_test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append(min_invitations_needed(n, p))

# Writing output to stdout
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
```

### Explanation of the new solution:

1. **`min_invitations_needed` Function**: This function identifies all unique friends that can attend the party given the invitations. It uses a depth-first search-like approach to visit each connected component of friends where each friend has received an invitation. It ensures to add a friend to the `visited_friends` set only once and adds their best friend to the stack for further exploration.

2. **Reading and Writing Input/Output**: The solution includes reading the number of test cases and processing each test case separately. After calculating the result for each test case, it prints the results separated by newlines to match the specified output format. 

3. **Optimization**: This solution might potentially offer better efficiency, especially in scenarios where there are multiple isolated groups of friends that do not need direct invitations to each other to meet the requirement of having at least two friends attending the party. By identifying and visiting each isolated group, it aims to minimize the total number of invitations sent.
