### Critique of the Original Solution:

**Pros:**

1. **Functionality:** The provided solution is functionally correct and solves the problem effectively. It utilizes a stack to keep track of characters while ensuring the sequence is in reverse order because it processes the string in reverse.

2. **Efficiency:** Although not explicitly mentioned, it has O(n) time complexity, making it efficient as it traverses each character of the input string exactly once.

3. **Clarity:** The function `max_subseq` is straightforward to understand, especially with comments that could help in understanding its purpose.

4. **Flexibility:** The solution should work well across different Python environments due to the simplicity of the code.

**Cons:**

1. **Docstrings:** Lack of docstrings can make the code less accessible to others who might read or use this code in the future. It would be beneficial to include short docstrings explaining what each part of the function does.

2. **Coding Style:** While the function name is descriptive, the variable names (`char`, `stack`) could be more meaningful to enhance readability, especially considering the nature of the task (finding the lexicographically maximum subsequence).

3. **Execution Flow Explanation:** The current approach might not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the method used for finding the maximum subsequence. Adding comments explaining the logic behind choosing elements from the stack could improve understanding.

### Revised Solution:

```python
def find_max_subseq(input_string):
    """
    Finds and returns the lexicographically maximum subsequence of a given string.
    
    Parameters:
    - input_string (str): A non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The lexicographically maximum subsequence.
    """
    # Initialize an empty stack to store characters in descending order
    max_seq_stack = []
    
    # Iterate over the string in reverse order
    for char in reversed(input_string):
        # While the current character is greater than the last added character in the stack, pop from the stack
        while max_seq_stack and char > max_seq_stack[-1]:
            max_seq_stack.pop()
        
        # Add the current character to the stack
        max_seq_stack.append(char)
    
    # Return the subsequence in the correct order
    return ''.join(max_seq_stack[::-1])

# Read input from stdin
input_str = input().strip()

# Process the input and print the result
print(find_max_subseq(input_str))
```

This revised solution includes:
- **Clear Function Documentation:** Docstrings provide a brief explanation of the function's purpose, parameters, and return type, aiding readability and maintainability.
- **Improved Variable Naming:** Renamed variables to better reflect their purpose, enhancing code clarity.
- **Enhanced Execution Flow Explanation:** Additional comments explain the logic behind choosing elements from the stack, improving understandability.
- **Consistent Coding Style:** Ensures uniformity in naming conventions and code structure, making the code cleaner and more professional.
