**Critique of the Original Solution:**

1. **Algorithm Efficiency:** The current solution employs dynamic programming with two separate DP tables (`dp_same` and `dp_diff`). While this approach ensures finding the optimal height, it does not optimize space usage since each table requires an array of `n+1` elements. 

2. **Code Readability and Clarity:** The code is clear, but it can be optimized in terms of space complexity. By combining the two DP tables into one and alternating between 'same' and 'diff' conditions within the same array, we could improve readability and reduce memory usage.

**Alternative Solution:**

```python
def max_height_efficient(n, heights_row1, heights_row2):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)  # Array to hold DP results
    dp[1] = heights_row1[0]  # First element of the first row
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Alternate between filling 'same' condition (first row) and 'diff' condition (second row)
        dp[2*i+1] = max(dp[2*i+1-1] + heights_row1[i], dp[2*i] + heights_row2[i])
        dp[2*i+2] = max(dp[2*i+2-1] + heights_row2[i], dp[2*i+1] + heights_row1[i])

    # The last two elements represent the 'same' and 'diff' condition respectively
    return max(dp[-1], dp[-2])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    n = int(input())
    heights_row1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    heights_row2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    print(max_height_efficient(n, heights_row1, heights_row2))
```

This alternative solution maintains the original logic but uses a single DP array to alternate between the 'same' and 'diff' conditions, thus reducing the space complexity while keeping the time complexity the same. The algorithm still runs in O(n) time because it iterates through each height once. The code remains readable and straightforward, with the efficiency improved due to optimized space usage.
