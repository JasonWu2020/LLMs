### Critique of the Original Solution:

**1. Algorithm Efficiency**: The current solution utilizes `groupby` from the `itertools` module, which iterates through all groups in the string separately. This process has a time complexity that could go up to O(n^2), depending on the number of '0's and '1's and their distribution in the input string. This is inefficient for large inputs.

**2. Memory Usage**: Using lists to store '0's and '1's might consume significant memory if there are many occurrences of either character. The memory usage scales linearly with the number of occurrences of the characters, potentially leading to high memory consumption.

**3. Complexity Reduction**: The approach takes multiple iterations to calculate possible solutions, increasing computational time.

### Revised Solution:
Here's a revised solution that maintains the core concept but optimizes for efficiency and reduces memory usage:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min_cost(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the minimum cost required to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.
    """
    # Count occurrences of '0' and '1'
    count_zeros = s.count('0')
    count_ones = len(s) - count_zeros
    
    # Find the optimal point where we split the string for minimum cost
    # This split should minimize the number of operations needed
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for pos in range(count_zeros + 1):
        cost_for_zeros = pos + sum(range(count_zeros - pos + 1)) + sum(range(pos + 1))
        cost_for_ones = count_ones + sum(range(count_ones - count_zeros + pos + 1)) + sum(range(pos + 1))
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_for_zeros + cost_for_ones)
        
    return min_cost

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(find_min_cost(s))
```

### Explanation of the Revised Approach:

**1. Counting '0's and '1's**: The counts help in calculating how many '0's and '1's are present, simplifying the calculation of costs related to them.

**2. Dynamic Optimization**: By iterating over possible splits (positions), the function finds the split that results in the minimum overall cost for transforming the string into a sorted form. This optimization significantly reduces the number of computations compared to the original solution.

**3. Memory Efficiency**: This solution does not require storing all occurrences of '0's and '1's in lists, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

By making these adjustments, the solution becomes more efficient, especially for larger input sizes, while still adhering to the problem statement's constraints.
