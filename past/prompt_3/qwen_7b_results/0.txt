**First Solution Critique**

The provided Python script successfully solves the problem with the right approach. It utilizes a sliding window technique, maintaining counts of characters within a valid subsequence at each position. The following are points that could be considered during critique:

1. **Efficiency**: The current solution runs in O(n) time complexity since it traverses the string once. However, there might be room for optimization if the constraints were significantly larger.

2. **Readability**: The code is well-structured and follows Python conventions. The function `find_longest_good_subsequence` is self-contained, taking necessary parameters as arguments. 

3. **Comments**: While comments could potentially help explain the logic further, they may not be needed due to the clarity of the code. Comments should generally improve readability, not detract from it. In this case, removing unnecessary comments would enhance simplicity.

4. **Resource Usage**: Since the solution uses a fixed-size list (`freq`) and counter (`count`), memory usage remains linear with respect to the size of the input. This could be a concern if the input size is very large.

**New Solution**

Here's an alternative approach that tries to simplify the logic a bit while keeping efficiency in mind. We're still aiming for a linear-time complexity solution, but the implementation style might differ:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def longest_good_subsequence(s):
    """
    Finds the length of the longest good subsequence of the string s.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string consisting of uppercase Latin alphabet letters.
    
    Returns:
    int: Length of the longest good subsequence.
    """
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0] * 27 for _ in range(n + 1)]  # dp[i][j]: length of longest good subseq ending at i with frequency j
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s, 1):
        prev_freq = [dp[j][k] for j, k in enumerate(dp[i-1]) if all(v == 0 or v == (char >= 'A'+chr(j)) for v in [k, k+1])]
        prev_freq.append(0)  # case when the char itself forms a valid subseq
        
        max_freq = 0
        for f in prev_freq:
            if f:
                max_freq = max(max_freq, f + (char >= 'A'))
        
        dp[i][max_freq] = max(1, max_freq) + 1  # including current char
    
    return max(max_freq for freq in dp[-1] if freq > 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input().strip()
    print(longest_good_subsequence(s))
```

This solution re-implements the logic using dynamic programming, aiming to keep the problem's essence while changing the implementation perspective. The goal was to make the solution concise yet clear, utilizing the power of dynamic programming to track the maximum frequency of subsequences as we iterate through the input string. 

Please note that the new solution might introduce complexity in understanding the underlying algorithm if not familiar with dynamic programming techniques. Therefore, both approaches can be valuable depending on the context in which the code needs to be written and maintained.
