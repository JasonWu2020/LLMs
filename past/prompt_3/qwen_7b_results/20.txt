**Critique of the provided solution:**

The solution posted above correctly follows all the guidelines provided:

1. **Problem Solving Approach**: The logic inside the `smallest_beautiful_number` function is correct, attempting to iterate backwards through the number `x` and trying to form the smallest beautiful number possible. It uses simple arithmetic operations and comparisons to find the correct digits for the result.

2. **Handling Carry**: The carry mechanism helps in adjusting the result when forming subsequent digits of the beautiful number. 

3. **Function Parameters and Return Types**: The function parameters and returned types are defined correctly, following the given problem description. The function returns the length of the resulting beautiful number and the beautiful number itself.

4. **Code Structure**: The code structure is clear and easy to understand, with good comments for understanding purposes.

5. **Input/Output Handling**: The program takes input correctly via stdin, processes the data, and outputs the result as required.

However, there are some minor issues:

- **Exception Handling**: There's no explicit exception handling, though the provided problem constraints (like `n <= 200,000`) and valid digit ranges ensure basic robustness against incorrect inputs. More robustness could involve validating the inputs at the beginning.

- **Performance Concerns**: The algorithm iterates backwards through the entire number `x` even after finding the smallest beautiful number. If `k` is significantly smaller than `n`, this might not be optimal. Depending on the specific constraints of large numbers, performance could be an issue.

**Alternative Solution:**

To address the potential performance concern, we can implement a different strategy. This involves building the beautiful number progressively, starting from the first digit of `x` and expanding towards the end, only replacing digits where necessary to maintain the beauty condition. This approach reduces the need for extensive backtracking after finding a suitable digit.

```python
def smallest_beautiful_number(n, k, digits):
    # Initialize the result with the first digit of x
    result_digits = [str(digits[0])]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        current_digit = int(result_digits[-1])
        
        # Check if the current digit satisfies the beauty condition
        if i >= k and current_digit == int(digits[i - k]):
            continue
        
        # Find the first digit that doesn't match the kth digit before it, starting from the current position
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + k)):
            if int(digits[j]) != int(digits[i]):
                current_digit = int(digits[j])
                break
        
        result_digits.append(str(current_digit))
        
    # Append remaining digits if any
    result_digits.extend(digits[len(result_digits):])
    
    return ''.join(result_digits)

# Read input from stdin
n, k = map(int, input().split())
digits = list(map(int, input()))

# Call the function with input values and print the result
result = smallest_beautiful_number(n, k, digits)
print(len(result))
print(result)
```

**Explanation**:

- This solution starts by adding the first digit to the result, then iterates through the rest of the digits of `x`, only changing a digit if it violates the beauty condition.

- The inner loop finds the minimum digit from `i` to `min(n, i + k)` that doesn't violate the condition and updates `current_digit`.

- After processing the entire string, any additional digits at the end of `x` are added to the result.

This solution aims to minimize unnecessary backtracking and potentially improve performance when `k` is small compared to `n`.
