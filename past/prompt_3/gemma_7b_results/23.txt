<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution is well-written, but it can be improved.

**Critique:**

* The code reads the input and stores it in variables `n` and `m`.
* It then iterates over the `m` buses and calculates the distance between the starting stop and the ending stop.
* The total distance is stored in the variable `g`.
* Finally, the remainder of `g` divided by 1000000007 is printed.

**Improvements:**

* The code can be made more concise by using a single loop to read the input and calculate the distance.
* The code can also be made more efficient by using a dictionary to store the distances so that they are not calculated repeatedly.

**Revised solution:**

```python3.8
n, m = map(int, input().split())
g = 0
distances = {}
for _ in range(m):
    s, t = map(int, input().split())
    if s not in distances:
        distances[s] = 0
    distances[s] += abs(t - s)
    g += distances[s]

print(g % 1000000007)
```<eos>
