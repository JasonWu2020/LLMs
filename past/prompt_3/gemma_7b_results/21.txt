**Critique:**

The solution is well-structured, and it uses the sorted list `a` effectively to find the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos. The variable `cur` keeps track of the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed in the current column, and the variable `ans` stores the total number of non-overlapping dominos. The code calculates the minimum of `cur` and `i` in the loop to ensure that the dominos are non-overlapping.

**Solution:**

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
ans = 0
cur = 0
for i in a:
    cur = max(cur, i - 1)
    ans += min(cur, i)
print(ans)
```

**Alternative Solution:**

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
ans = 0
cur = 0
for i in a:
    cur = max(cur, i - 1)
    ans += i - cur
print(ans)
```

This solution calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed in the current column by subtracting `cur` from `i`. The variable `cur` is updated to the maximum of the current value and the previous column's maximum number of non-overlapping dominos. This ensures that the dominos are non-overlapping.<eos>
