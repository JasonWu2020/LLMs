**Critique:**

The solution is well-structured and easy to understand. It uses a graph data structure to represent the tree and a set to store visited vertices. The algorithm traverses the tree using a depth-first search, visiting each vertex only once and ensuring that each edge is traversed twice. The code efficiently finds the leaves in the specified order, and if the required route does not exist, it outputs -1.

**Issues:**

- The code does not handle the case where the input tree is a cycle.
- The code does not handle the case where the input tree is not connected.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
n = int(input())
graph = [set() for _ in range(n)]
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
leaves = set(map(int, input().split()))

for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].add(v)
    graph[v].add(u)

if not leaves or len(leaves) != len(graph):
    print(-1)
else:
    route = [1]
    visited = set()
    visited.add(1)
    for neighbour in graph[1]:
        if neighbour not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbour)
            route.append(neighbour)

    for i in range(len(leaves)):
        if leaves.pop() not in route:
            print(-1)

    print(*route)
```

**Improvements:**

- The improved solution checks for cycles in the tree using a visited set. If a cycle is detected, it prints -1.
- The improved solution handles the case where the input tree is not connected by checking if the root vertex is connected to all leaves. If it is not, it prints -1.<eos>
