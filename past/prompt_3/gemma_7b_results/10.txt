<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient, but it can be improved. The code reads the input, calculates the total height of each row, and then finds the maximum possible total height of players in a team. However, it does not consider the case where the first student in the team is chosen from the second row. In this case, the maximum possible total height of players in a team is the sum of the heights of the first student in the second row and the remaining students in the first row.

**Improved Solution:**

```python3.8

n = int(input())
h1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
h2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

h_total = max(h1 + h2)
print(sum(h_total) - h_total[0])
```<eos>
