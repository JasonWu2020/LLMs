<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution is correct, but it can be improved.

**Critique:**

* **Logic:** The code calculates the time taken to cover the distance `d` at speed `v` and adds 1 if the distance is not divisible by the speed. This ensures that the car reaches the traffic lights at the green light.
* **Speed:** The code assumes that the car can accelerate and decelerate instantaneously, which is not realistic. In reality, there will be a transition time between acceleration and deceleration.
* **Time Complexity:** The code calculates the time taken to cover the distance `d` only once, which is efficient.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
l, d, v, g, r = map(int, input().split())
t = d // v
if d % v == 0:
    print(t)
else:
    print(t + 1)

# Add additional time for acceleration and deceleration
t_accel = d * v // 2
t_dec = d * v // 2

total_time = t + t_accel + t_dec
print(total_time)
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The improved solution considers the time required for acceleration and deceleration, which is proportional to the distance covered.
* The time complexity of the improved solution is slightly higher than the original solution, as it calculates the time taken for acceleration and deceleration separately.
* The improved solution is more realistic, as it accounts for the time required for acceleration and deceleration.<eos>
