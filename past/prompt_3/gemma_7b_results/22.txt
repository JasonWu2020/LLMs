**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient, but it could be improved.

- **Conciseness:** The code is only a few lines long, but it uses the `set` data structure to store the distinct characters in the string, which increases the space complexity.
- **Efficiency:** The code iterates over the string only once, which is efficient, but the use of the `set` data structure can make the time complexity higher.

**Improved solution:**

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
s = ''.join(sorted(set(s) & set(s[:k]), key=s.index))
m = len(s.split())
print(m)
print(s)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the input data and stores the number of characters to be deleted in the variable `k`.
- It then reads the input string `s`.
- It creates a set of distinct characters in `s` and intersects it with the first `k` characters in the string.
- The set is converted back into a sorted list, and the characters are joined together into a new string.
- The number of distinct characters in the new string is stored in `m`.
- Finally, the number and the new string are printed.

**Time complexity:**

- The code iterates over the input string only once, so the time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- The use of the set data structure can increase the time complexity, but the complexity is still O(n) on average.

**Space complexity:**

- The code uses a set data structure to store the distinct characters, which has a space complexity of O(n) where n is the number of distinct characters in the input string.<eos>
