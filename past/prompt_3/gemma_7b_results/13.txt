**Critique:**

The solution reads the input string, converts it into a set of characters, and then sorts the characters in ascending order. Finally, it joins the sorted characters back into a string. This solution is concise and efficient, but it does not preserve the original order of the characters in the input string.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
s = input().strip()
print("".join(sorted(s) ))
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input string *s*, strips whitespace, and converts it into a list of characters.
* The characters are sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.
* The sorted characters are joined back into a string using the `join()` method.
* The resulting string is printed.<eos>
