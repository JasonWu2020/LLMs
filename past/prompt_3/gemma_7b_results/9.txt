**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient, as it calculates the minimum of `k` and `n` and subtracts 1 from it. However, it does not handle the case where `k` is 0 correctly. In this case, the output should be 0, but the code will output -1.

**Revised Solution:**

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(min(k, n) - 1 if k else 0)
```<eos>
