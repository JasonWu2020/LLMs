[/INST] The outputted solution reads the input from `stdin` using the `sys` module, which may not be allowed in some contest environments. It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string. Then it filters out the characters that have a count greater than `k`. The length of the resulting dictionary is the answer. After that, it generates all possible substrings of the original string and checks if the count of distinct characters in each substring is less than or equal to `k`. The substring with the minimum length is the output.

This solution may be too slow for large inputs due to generating all substrings. Here's a faster alternative using dynamic programming:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
count = [0] * 26
for char in s:
 count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
 dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
 dp[0] = 0
 for i in range(1, len(s)):
 for j in range(i, k + 1):
 dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - 1] + 1)
 ans = dp[k]
 distinct = set()
 for i in range(len(s)):
 if dp[k] - dp[dp[i]] <= k - len(s) + i:
 distinct.add(ord(s[i]) - ord('a'))
 print(len(distinct))
 print(''.join(chr(x + ord('a') for x in distinct)))
```

This solution uses an array `count` to keep track of the count of each character, and an array `dp` to store the length of the longest subsequence with at most `k` distinct characters ending at each position `i`. It iterates through the string and updates the minimum length of the subsequence with at most `k` distinct characters ending at each position. The answer is the length of the longest such subsequence, and the distinct characters are found by iterating through the string again and checking if the length of the subsequence ending at the current position with at most `k` distinct characters is equal to `k - (length of the string - current position) + current position`.</s>
