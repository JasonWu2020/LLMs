[/INST] The outputted solution is a valid Python solution for the given problem, but it can be improved in terms of readability and efficiency. The use of memoization via functools.lru\_cache is not strictly necessary in this case, as the subproblem solutions can be easily computed recursively without storing them in a cache. Moreover, a more concise and readable solution can be achieved using dynamic programming.

Here's a more readable and efficient solution:

```python
def max_subseq(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = s[i]
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            dp[i][j] = s[i] if s[i] > s[j-1] and i == j-1 else dp[i+1][j] if dp[i+1][j] > dp[i][j] else s[i]
    return dp[-1][-1]

s = input().strip()
print(max_subseq(s))
```</s>
