[/INST] The outputted solution uses the following approaches:

1. It reads the input from the standard input using Python's built-in `sys` module.
2. It initializes the maze with the given dimensions and the starting point.
3. It sets the initial direction vectors and a counter for the number of steps the boy can take.
4. It enters an infinite loop, where it calculates the next cell to move to based on the current cell and the direction vectors.
5. If the next cell is a valid, passable cell, the boy moves to it, and the counter is incremented.
6. If the next cell is a wall or the counter is zero, the boy checks if he can go infinitely far by checking if the counter is greater than zero.
7. If the boy can go infinitely far, it prints "Yes" and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints "No" and exits the program.

The solution can be improved in several ways:

1. The input can be read from a file instead of the standard input to make it more robust and easier to test.
2. The solution can be wrapped in a function to make it more reusable and testable.
3. The solution can be written more concisely by using list comprehensions and vectorized operations.

Here's a more concise solution:

```python
def can_go_infinitely_far(maze, x, y):
    directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
    count = 0

    while True:
        nx, ny = (x + dx[0] * len(maze[0]) + dy[0], y + dy[1] * len(maze[0]) + dx[1])
        if 0 <= nx < len(maze) and 0 <= ny < len(maze[0]) and maze[nx][ny] != "#":
            x, y = nx, ny
            count += 1
        else:
            if count > 0:
                return "Yes"
            else:
                return "No"

n, m = map(int, input().split())
maze = [[c for c in input().strip()] for _ in range(n)]
x, y = 0, 0
print(can_go_infinitely_far(maze, x, y))
