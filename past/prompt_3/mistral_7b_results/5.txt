[/INST] The outputted solution correctly reads the input and prints the output as required. However, it could be improved in terms of readability and efficiency. The provided solution uses a list comprehension to create a queue for storing the substring lengths and their corresponding costs. Instead, we can use a more conventional data structure like a list or a deque. Additionally, the solution can be optimized by processing the string from left to right, maintaining the current cost and the index of the last bit that changed. Here's an optimized solution:

```python
def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost, pos = 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i > 0 and s[i] != s[i-1] or s[i] != s[pos]:
            cost += i - pos + 1
            pos = i
    return cost

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys, io
    input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input().strip()
        print(solve(s))
```

This solution reads the input and prints the output as required and has a better time complexity compared to the initial solution.</s>
