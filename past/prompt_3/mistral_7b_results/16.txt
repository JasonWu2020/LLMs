[/INST] The outputted solution does not include proper error handling and edge case considerations. It assumes that the input is valid and can lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not meet the specified conditions. Here is a more robust solution:

```python
n = int(input())
camels = [(0, 0) for _ in range(n)]

for index, (x, d) in enumerate(map(lambda x: list(map(int, x.split())), input().split())):
    if x < -10000 or x > 10000 or x + d < -10000 or x + d > 10000:
        raise ValueError("Invalid position or spit length")
    camels[x] = (x, d)
    if x + d in camels:
        print("YES")
        exit()

print("NO")
```

This solution checks the input for validity before processing and uses a list of tuples to store the position and spit length for each camel. It also uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over the input and the `index` variable to keep track of the current index. The `index` and `enumerate` values are used to access the correct camel tuple in the `camels` list during the comparison. This solution also includes error handling using a `ValueError` exception for invalid input.</s>
