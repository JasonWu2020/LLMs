### Critique of the Provided Solution

#### Strengths:
1. **Use of Dynamic Programming**: The function efficiently handles the sliding window logic to calculate the maximum length of a "good" subsequence. It utilizes a list to keep track of the frequency of each character within the sliding window, making sure they match the position in the alphabet.

2. **Handling Special Cases**: The function handles scenarios where the current character doesn't match the required frequency efficiently by adjusting the counts of previous characters within the window.

3. **Readable Code Structure**: The code is relatively clean and well-structured. It follows a logical flow from initialization, reading the problem inputs, performing calculations, and providing outputs.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Potential for Off-by-One Errors**: When calculating indices to adjust counts after adding/removing elements from the sliding window, there might be potential off-by-one errors, particularly when implementing edge cases such as when the window is too small or when the sequence ends.

2. **Assumption on Input Range**: The solution assumes the problem specifications regarding the input range and types (strings up to 10^5 characters and integers up to 26). It may fail if these constraints are violated.

### New Solution

```python
from typing import List

def longest_good_subsequence(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Mapping of character to its position in the alphabet
    char_to_index = {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'G': 6, 'H': 7, 'I': 8, 'J': 9,
                     'K': 10, 'L': 11, 'M': 12, 'N': 13, 'O': 14, 'P': 15, 'Q': 16, 'R': 17, 'S': 18,
                     'T': 19, 'U': 20, 'V': 21, 'W': 22, 'X': 23, 'Y': 24, 'Z': 25}

    # Initialize frequency list and maximum length
    freq_list = [0] * 26
    max_length = 0

    # Iterate over the string
    for char in s:
        idx = char_to_index[char]
        if freq_list[idx] == idx:
            max_length += 1
            freq_list[idx] += 1
        else:
            # Adjust counts based on current index
            while freq_list[idx] != idx or idx > 0:
                freq_list[char_to_index[s[max(0, idx - 1)]]] -= 1
                idx -= 1
            freq_list[char_to_index[char]] += 1

    return max_length

# Reading input directly into variables rather than using input() function
n, k = 8, 3
s = "ACBCAB"

# Call function and print result
print(longest_good_subsequence(s, k))
```

### Explanation
- The `char_to_index` dictionary simplifies the conversion between characters and their positions in the alphabet, making the solution cleaner.
- The solution iterates through the string `s`, updating counts in the frequency list and adjusting the sliding window as needed to ensure the "good" subsequence criteria are met.

### Note
This critique and the provided alternative solution aim to clarify potential improvements in terms of code clarity, error handling, and efficiency. In practice, the initial solution might still perform reasonably well due to its already efficient approach to the problem.
