### Solution 1:

```python3
import sys

def max_height(n, heights):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        if i > 1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 2] + heights[i - 2])
    return dp[n]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    result = max_height(n, heights)
    print(result)
```

### Critique of Solution 1:

This Python solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum possible total height of players in a team. It iterates through the students' heights, updating an array `dp` which keeps track of the maximum sum of heights for different lengths of teams. The final answer is found at `dp[n]`. This approach ensures optimal performance with time complexity \(O(n)\).

However, there could still be room for optimization depending on specific requirements or constraints not mentioned here.

### Solution 2:

Given the nature of the problem and the fact that it requires finding the maximum possible total height of players in a team while avoiding consecutive students from the same row, we need to ensure that our algorithm respects these constraints. Hereâ€™s a revised version considering this requirement more explicitly:

```python3
def max_team_height(n, heights):
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Fill DP table
    for length in range(1, n+1):
        for start in range(length):
            end = min(start + 2*length - 1, n)
            dp[start][end] = max(
                dp[start][start],
                dp[start][end-1] + heights[end-1] - heights[start-1],
                dp[start+1][end] + heights[start-1] - heights[end-1]
            )
    
    return dp[0][-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    result = max_team_height(n, heights)
    print(result)
```

### Critique of Solution 2:

Solution 2 introduces a more explicit handling of the constraint that students cannot be chosen consecutively from the same row. By using nested loops to iterate over potential segments of the array and calculating valid subarrays, it ensures that the selected students respect the row constraint. 

This solution maintains the O(n^2) time complexity due to its use of dynamic programming, making it suitable for large inputs within the given constraints. However, it might require careful consideration regarding edge cases or further optimizations based on specific implementation details or runtime requirements.
