### Given Problem:
Little boy Gerald needs help calculating the number of ways he can travel from his home to the school using buses.

### Input Specification:
The first line contains two space-separated integers `n` and `m`. The next `m` lines contain two integers each for `si` and `ti`, representing the start and end bus stops of the `i`th bus.

### Output Specification:
Output the total number of ways Gerald can reach the school modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Sample Inputs/Outputs:

#### Sample Input 1:
```
5 3
0 1
1 2
2 3
```

#### Expected Output 1:
```
3
```

#### Explanation:
Gerald can take bus 0 to stop 0, then bus 1 to stop 1, then bus 2 to stop 2. He cannot take bus 3 because it doesn't exist.

#### Sample Input 2:
```
2 1
0 1
```

#### Expected Output 2:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
No bus runs from stop 0 to stop 1.

#### Sample Input 3:
```
5 4
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

#### Expected Output 3:
```
16
```

### Python 3.8 Code Solution:
```python
import sys

# Function to calculate combinations of choosing k elements from n elements
def combination(n, k):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

# Function to compute the result based on the given constraints
def compute_ways():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Precompute factorials up to 1e9
    factorials = [1] * (10**9 + 1)
    for i in range(1, 10**9 + 1):
        factorials[i] = factorials[i - 1] * i
    
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each bus route
    for _ in range(m):
        si, ti = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of ways to reach stop ti from stop si
        ways_to_reach_ti = combination(ti, si + 1)
        
        # Multiply by previous results
        if len(results) > 0:
            ways_to_reach_ti *= results[-1]
        
        # Apply modulo operation
        ways_to_reach_ti %= mod
        
        # Append the current result to the list
        results.append(ways_to_reach_ti)
    
    # Return the last element as the final result
    return results[-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(compute_ways())
```

### Critique of the Provided Solution:
This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each bus stop. It precomputes factorials up to \(10^9\) to speed up calculations. The main loop iterates over each bus route, calculates the number of ways to reach the destination stop, and multiplies by previously computed values. Finally, it returns the last value in the list, which represents the total number of ways to reach the school modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Alternative Solution:
A more efficient approach could use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Hereâ€™s an alternative solution that uses dynamic programming with memoization:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(None)
def dp(start, end):
    if start >= end:
        return 1
    else:
        count = 0
        for mid in range(start + 1, end):
            count += dp(start, mid) + dp(mid, end)
        return count % (10**9 + 7)

n, m = map(int, input().split())

for _ in range(m):
    si, ti = map(int, input().split())
    print(dp(si, ti))
```

### Critique of the Alternative Solution:
This alternative solution uses dynamic programming with memoization (`lru_cache`) to store intermediate results. By caching these results, it avoids recalculating them when they have already been computed, significantly reducing computation time for larger inputs. This approach ensures that each state is only processed once, leading to optimal performance.
