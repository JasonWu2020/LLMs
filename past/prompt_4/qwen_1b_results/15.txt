### Critique of Provided Solution:

The provided Python solution attempts to solve the problem by attempting all possible permutations of assigning vertices to points. However, this approach is computationally expensive and inefficient due to its exponential time complexity. It does not guarantee finding the correct solution within reasonable bounds, especially when \( n \) is large.

### Proposed Solution:

To address the inefficiency and computational challenges, we can leverage a more efficient algorithm like Kruskal's Algorithm for Prim's Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree (MST). Given the constraints, the MST will ensure that the maximum number of edges are used while connecting all vertices, minimizing redundant connections. We can then use these edges to determine the best assignment of vertices to points, ensuring that no two connected vertices share the same point.

Hereâ€™s how it would work:

1. **Find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Use Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm to construct the MST based on the edges connecting the vertices.
2. **Assign Points:** Assign each edge in the MST to a unique point, ensuring that no two connected vertices end up at the same point.
3. **Verify Solution:** Ensure that every pair of connected vertices shares exactly one common point.

This method significantly reduces the search space compared to brute-force permutation checking, making it much faster and more feasible for larger values of \( n \).

Please note that implementing this specific algorithm efficiently might require additional details such as handling ties and other edge cases, but the core idea remains straightforward.
