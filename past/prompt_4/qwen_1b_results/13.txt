Solution:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def find_max_subsequence(s):
    max_subseq = ""
    for perm in permutations(s):
        current_subseq = ''.join(perm)
        if current_subseq > max_subseq:
            max_subseq = current_subseq
    return max_subseq

# Example usage:
input_string = "abracadabra"
print(find_max_subsequence(input_string))
```

This Python solution uses permutations from the itertools module to generate all possible subsequences of the given string `s`. It then iterates through these subsequences, comparing them lexicographically to find the one that is largest. Finally, it returns this largest subsequence.

To critique this solution:

1. **Efficiency**: Permutations can be computationally expensive for large strings due to the factorial time complexity. For inputs up to 10^5 characters, this might work well enough. However, for much larger inputs, more efficient algorithms or data structures would be needed.

2. **Memory Usage**: The use of permutations creates a new sequence each iteration which could lead to significant memory usage for large inputs.

3. **Edge Cases**: The provided example includes an edge case where the string consists entirely of repeating characters ('aaaa'). In practice, we should ensure our algorithm handles all cases including repeated characters properly.

4. **Code Readability**: While simple, there may be room for improvement in terms of readability, especially when dealing with complex logic like handling permutations.

Alternative Solution:

For better performance on large inputs, consider using dynamic programming to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position. Hereâ€™s how you could implement it:

```python
def find_max_subsequence_dp(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [1] * n
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if s[i] >= s[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    # Find the maximum value in the DP table
    max_length = max(dp)
    
    # Reconstruct the longest increasing subsequence
    result = []
    length = max_length - 1
    while length >= 0:
        if dp[length] == max_length:
            result.append(s[length])
            break
        else:
            length -= 1
            
    # Reverse the result to get the correct order
    result.reverse()
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage:
input_string = "abracadabra"
print(find_max_subsequence_dp(input_string))
```

This alternative solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the longest increasing subsequence and reconstructs it accordingly. This approach avoids generating all permutations, making it faster and more scalable for larger inputs.
