Solution:

```python3
import sys

def maxSlimeValue(n, values):
    dp = [values[0]] + [0] * (n - 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if values[i] >= values[i - 1]:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + values[i])
        
        if values[i] <= values[i - 1]:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] - values[i])
            
    return max(dp)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(maxSlimeValue(n, values))
```

This Python program solves the given problem efficiently using dynamic programming. The `maxSlimeValue` function takes two arguments: `n`, which represents the total number of slimes, and `values`, which is a list containing the integer values associated with each slime. It calculates the maximum possible value of the last slime after all slimes have been eaten.

To run the solution as a code snippet on the server, simply copy and paste the provided Python code into your submission form. Make sure to adhere to the guidelines specified in the original problem statement regarding input/output format and constraints.
