[/INST] The provided solution reads the input and computes the repeating sequence and the length of the beautiful integer $y$. However, there are a few issues with the solution:

1. It doesn't handle the edge case where the number of digits $n$ is not a multiple of $k$. In this case, the last repeating sequence may not be complete and might have fewer than $k$ digits.
2. It doesn't check if the digits in the repeating sequence are all the same. In the unlikely event that the repeating sequence doesn't consist of the same digits, the problem statement states that $b_i = b_{i+k}$ for each $i$, which may not hold in this case.
3. The solution does not follow the given output format (printing the digits of $y$ separately).

A corrected solution that adheres to the given input and output specifications:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
n, k = map(int, input)
x = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

repeating_sequence = x[:k]
repeats = len(x) // k

if len(repeating_sequence) != k:
    print(-1)
    exit()

m = (repeats + 1) * k
beautiful_number = "0" * (m - len(x)) + x[:k]

print(m)
for digit in beautiful_number:
    print(digit, end=" ")
print()
```

This solution checks if the repeating sequence has the correct length and prints the beautiful number's digits in the correct format.</s>
