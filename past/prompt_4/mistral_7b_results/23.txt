[/INST] The outputted solution is a valid solution to the problem. However, it can be optimized in a few ways.

First, instead of using a 2D array `dp`, we can use a single array `dp[n+1]` to represent the number of ways to reach each bus stop. This reduces the space complexity from O(nm) to O(n).

Second, instead of iterating through the buses in order, we can sort them based on their starting stops and then process them in sorted order. This allows us to avoid recomputing the number of ways to reach each stop multiple times.

Here's the optimized solution:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline

n, m = map(int, input().split())
buses = sorted([(bus[0], bus[1], bus[1]-bus[0]) for bus in [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]))

dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[0] = 1

for bus_start, _, bus_capacity in buses:
    for i in range(min(bus_start, n) - 1, -1, -1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i + bus_capacity]) % 1000000007

print(dp[n])
```</s>
