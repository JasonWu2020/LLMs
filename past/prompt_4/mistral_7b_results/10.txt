[/INST] The outputted solution is correct in terms of logic and follows the given problem statement. However, there are some improvements that can be made to make the code more readable and efficient.

First, the input reading can be simplified by using list comprehension instead of map and sys.stdin.readline() multiple times. This will make the input reading more concise and easier to read.

Second, the recursive formula in the dp table calculation can be simplified by using a nested loop instead of a list comprehension, which may be more efficient for larger inputs.

Third, the variable names can be made more descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.

Here's the improved solution:

```python
n = list(map(int, input().split()))
h1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
h2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

# initialize dp table
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

# base cases
dp[0][0] = h1[0]

# calculate dp table
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    dp[i][i] = dp[i - 1][i - 1] + h1[i - 1] + h2[i - 1]
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][k] + h2[j] for k in range(i, j))

print(dp[n][n])
```</s>
