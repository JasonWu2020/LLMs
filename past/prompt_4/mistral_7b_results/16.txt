[/INST] The outputted solution correctly reads the input and solves the problem, but it could benefit from some improvements:

1. Input validation: The input specifications state that the positions are integers between -10^4 and 10^4, but the input is currently assumed to be a string and parsed using `map(int, input().split())`. It would be better to validate the input before parsing it.
2. Exiting the loop after finding a matching pair: The solution exits the loop as soon as it finds a matching pair, but the remaining iterations are unnecessary.
3. Handling negative spitting distances: The current solution does not handle negative spitting distances correctly. If a camel spits to the left, it can hit a camel at a position to the left of its current position.

Here's an improved solution:

```python
import sys

n = int(input())
positions = []

for _ in range(n):
    x, d = input().split()
    x = int(x)
    d = int(d) if d >= 0 else -d
    positions.append((x, d))

for i, (x, d) in enumerate(positions):
    for j in range(i+1, len(positions)):
        if abs(positions[j][0] - x) <= abs(positions[j][1]):
            print("YES")
            exit()

print("NO")
