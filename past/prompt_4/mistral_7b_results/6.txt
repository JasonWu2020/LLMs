[/INST] The outputted solution correctly reads the input according to the specifications and prints the answer for each test case. However, it could be improved in the following ways:

1. The variable names could be more descriptive and follow the snake\_case naming convention.
2. The function `read_input()` could return a list of lists instead of modifying the global `test_cases` list.
3. The function `min_sum()` could take the input arguments in a more natural order and return only the result instead of modifying the global `dp` list.

Here's a revised version of the solution:

```python
import sys

def read_input():
    return [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(int(input()))]

def min_sum(n, k, arr):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = arr[0]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + arr[i - 1])
        if i > 1 and k > 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 2] + arr[i - 1])
            k -= 1
    return dp[n]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases = read_input()
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, k, arr = test_case
        print(min_sum(n, k, arr))
```</s>
