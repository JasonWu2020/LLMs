[/INST] The provided solution reads the input, initializes the sequence `g` with the given `g_0` value, and then calculates the sequence iteratively using the given formula. The number of subrectangles is calculated, and the minimum heights of each subrectangle are found by selecting the minimum height in the corresponding range of the sequence `g`. The sum of the minimum heights is the final answer.

However, the input specification states that the sequence `g` is given, and we should use the given sequence to calculate the minimum heights of the subrectangles. The solution provided generates the sequence `g` from the given parameters `g_0`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which is not according to the problem statement.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys

n, m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
g = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))

subrectangles = int(n * (m - b + 1) // a)
min_heights = [g[i: i + a] for i in range(0, len(g), a * m)]
answer = sum([min(min_heights[i]) for i in range(subrectangles)])
print(answer)
```

This solution reads the input as given, initializes the sequence `g` from the input, and then calculates the minimum heights of the subrectangles by slicing the sequence `g` into submatrices of size `a * m` and finding the minimum height in each submatrix. The sum of the minimum heights is the final answer.</s>
