[/INST] The outputted solution reads the input using `sys.stdin.readline()`, which is not the standard way to read input in Python for competitive programming. Instead, we should use `input()` to read the input as strings and then use the `map()` function to convert them to integers.

Here's a corrected version of the solution that adheres to the input and output specifications:

```python
n = int(input())
h1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
h2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

i, j, total_height = 0, 0, 0

while i < n and j < n:
    if h1[i] > h2[j]:
        total_height += h1[i]
        i += 1    else:
        j += 1

print(total_height)
```

This corrected solution reads the input using `input()`, converts it to a list of integers using `map()`, and then uses the rest of the algorithm as before to find the maximum possible total height of players in a team Demid can choose.</s>
