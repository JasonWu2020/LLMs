Critique of the outputted solution:

1. The solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, which is a good approach for this type of problem.
2. The solution is well-structured and easy to follow.
3. However, the variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `h11` and `h22` could be renamed to `heights1` and `heights2` to better convey their purpose.
4. The solution assumes that the input is well-formed and does not handle any potential errors. In a real-world scenario, you would want to add error handling code to handle cases where the input is invalid.
5. The solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for this problem.

Here's an alternative solution that addresses these issues:

```python
def max_height(n, heights1, heights2):
    heights1.sort()
    heights2.sort()
    max_height = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_height = max(max_height, heights1[i] + heights2[i])
    return max_height

n = int(input())
heights1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
heights2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(max_height(n, heights1, heights2))
```

This solution sorts the heights of both rows and then iterates over the rows, selecting the maximum possible height for each row. This approach is simpler and more intuitive than the original solution, and it avoids the need for dynamic programming.

However, this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, which is less efficient than the original solution. If performance is a concern, the original solution is still the better choice.
