Critique of the outputted solution:

The outputted solution is incorrect. It only handles the case where n is even and the sum of the first set is even. However, it does not handle the case where the sum of the first set is odd.

Here are some issues with the solution:

- The solution only checks if n is odd or even, but it does not check if the sum of the first set is even or odd. This means that it may not always find a valid partition.

- The solution only handles the case where n is even and the sum of the first set is even. It does not handle the case where n is even and the sum of the first set is odd.

- The solution does not handle the case where n is odd.

- The solution does not use a systematic approach to partition the numbers into two sets. It simply adds numbers to the first set if the sum of the first set is even and to the second set if the sum of the first set is odd. This approach may not always find a valid partition.

Here is a revised solution that adheres to the same input and output specifications:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print("No")
        return
    for i in range(3, n + 1, 2):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            print("Yes")
            print(1, 2, i)
            return
    print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution starts by checking if n is 1. If it is, it prints "No" and returns. If n is greater than 1, it starts checking numbers from 3 onwards. If a number is odd, it prints "Yes", prints the first set with 1, 2, and the current number, and returns. If it checks all numbers and does not find a valid partition, it prints "No".
