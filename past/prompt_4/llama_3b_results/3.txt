Critique of the outputted solution:

* The solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, which is correct.
* However, the solution has a space complexity of O(n) due to the sorting, which is not optimal.
* The solution only checks if the next slime has a negative value, which is not the optimal way to find the maximum possible value of the last slime.
* The solution only updates the maximum value seen so far when a slime with a value greater than the maximum value seen so far is encountered, which is not the optimal way to find the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Here is a new solution that addresses these issues:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_max(a):
    max_val = float('-inf')
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > max_val:
            max_val = a[i]
        if a[i] < 0:
            break
    return max_val

def find_min(a):
    min_val = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < min_val:
            min_val = a[i]
        if a[i] > 0:
            break
    return min_val

max_val = find_max(a)
min_val = find_min(a)
print(max_val - min_val)
```

This solution first finds the maximum and minimum values in the array, then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values to get the maximum possible value of the last slime. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), which is more efficient than the previous solution.
