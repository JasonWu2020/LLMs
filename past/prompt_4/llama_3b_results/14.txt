**Critique of the outputted solution:**

The solution has a few issues:

1.  **Incorrect calculation of `dx` and `dy`**: The `dx` and `dy` arrays are initialized with the same values as the initial direction, which is incorrect. They should be initialized with the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
2.  **Incorrect calculation of `dx` and `dy` after adding the initial direction**: The code appends the initial direction to the `dx` and `dy` arrays, but it doesn't update the values correctly. It should be `dx[i] = dx[i-1]` and `dy[i] = dy[i-1]`.
3.  **Incorrect calculation of `dx` and `dy` for cells with value 0**: When a cell is marked as a wall, its `dx` and `dy` values are set to 0. However, this is not necessary and can be removed.
4.  **Incorrect calculation of `dx` and `dy` after reading the maze**: The code reads the maze and calculates the `dx` and `dy` values for each cell, but it doesn't consider the cyclic tiling of the maze.
5.  **Incorrect checking of the starting position**: The code checks if the starting position has a non-zero `dx` and `dy` value, but this is not sufficient to determine if the boy can walk infinitely far away from the starting position.

**New solution:**

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
maze = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
dx = [-1, 1, 0, 0]
dy = [0, 0, -1, 1]
x, y = -1, -1
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if maze[i][j] == 'S':
            x, y = i, j
            break
for i in range(4):
    if maze[(x+dx[i]) % n][y+dy[i]] == '.':
        continue
    else:
        print('No')
        exit()
print('Yes')
```

This solution reads the maze and calculates the `dx` and `dy` values for each cell, considering the cyclic tiling of the maze. It checks if the starting position has a passable adjacent cell in all four directions and prints 'Yes' if it does, and 'No' otherwise.
