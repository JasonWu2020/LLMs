The outputted solution is not optimal. It only considers the case where the current elements in both lists are equal, and it doesn't consider the case where the current element in list A is smaller than the current element in list B.

Here's a critique of the solution:

*   It doesn't handle the case where the current elements in both lists are equal. In this case, it should choose the larger element to maximize the difference.
*   It doesn't handle the case where the current element in list A is smaller than the current element in list B. In this case, it should remove the smaller element to minimize the difference.
*   It doesn't use the fact that the lists are sorted, which can be used to optimize the solution.

Here's a new solution that adheres to the same input and output specifications:

```python
n = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

A.sort()
B.sort()

i = j = 0
total_A = 0
total_B = 0
num_B = len(B)

while i < n and j < num_B:
    if A[i] > B[j]:
        total_A += A[i]
        i += 1
        j += 1
    elif A[i] < B[j]:
        total_B += B[j]
        j += 1
    else:
        total_A += A[i]
        total_B += B[j]
        i += 1
        j += 1

if i < n:
    total_A += sum(A[i:])

if j < num_B:
    total_B += sum(B[j:])

print(total_A - total_B)
```

This solution works by maintaining two pointers, `i` and `j`, to track the current position in lists A and B, respectively. It first tries to choose the larger element from the current positions in both lists. If the elements are equal, it chooses the larger element. If the element in list A is smaller, it removes the element from list B to minimize the difference. If the element in list B is smaller, it removes the element from list A to maximize the difference. After that, it moves the corresponding pointer to the next element. This solution ensures that the difference between the scores is maximized.
