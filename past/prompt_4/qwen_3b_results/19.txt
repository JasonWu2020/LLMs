# Reading input
n = int(input().strip())
edges = [list(map(int, input().strip().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]

```

This Python script reads the input, processes it using depth-first search (DFS), and constructs the required path. It checks for the existence of the path and prints the sequence of vertices the ant should visit. If no such path exists, it outputs `-1`.

Please note that the function `find_path` assumes that the given tree structure and leaf orderings are valid and that all necessary conditions are met. If these assumptions do not hold, the function may fail to produce a correct output.
