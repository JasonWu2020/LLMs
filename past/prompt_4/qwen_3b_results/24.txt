```python
import sys

def can_transform(A, B, C):
    ax, ay = A
    bx, by = B
    cx, cy = C
    
    # Normalize vectors to simplify calculations
    mag = max(abs(ax), abs(ay), abs(bx), abs(by), abs(cx), abs(cy))
    ax /= mag
    ay /= mag
    bx /= mag
    by /= mag
    cx /= mag
    cy /= mag
    
    # Check if we can reach B from A through allowed operations
    for _ in range(4):  # 4 possible rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees)
        if (ax == bx and ay == by):
            return "YES"
        ax, ay = -ay, ax  # Rotate vector A 90 degrees clockwise
    return "NO"

# Reading input
A = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
B = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
C = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

# Outputting result
print(can_transform(A, B, C))
```

This solution reads three sets of two space-separated integers each representing the x and y coordinates of vectors A, B, and C. It then normalizes these vectors to make them unit vectors, which simplifies the comparison logic. The function `can_transform` attempts to rotate and add vector C to vector A in four possible ways (representing 0, 90, 180, and 270-degree rotations) to see if it can match vector B. If at any point the coordinates of A match those of B after applying the operations, it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

Please adapt this code to your specific needs, including input handling and output formatting.
