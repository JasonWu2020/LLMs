```python
import sys

def solve_tree_placement(n, edges, points):
    # Build adjacency list for the tree
    tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)

    # Initialize the solution array
    placement = [0] * n

    def dfs(node=1, parent=-1):
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dfs(child, node)
                placement[child] = node
        placement[node] = node

    dfs()
    return placement

# Reading input
n = int(input())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Getting the solution
solution = solve_tree_placement(n, edges, points)
print(' '.join(map(str, solution)))
```

This Python script reads the input as specified, builds the tree structure, and then uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to determine the correct placement of points on the plane such that the tree edges connect the correct points. Finally, it prints out the placement of each point.
