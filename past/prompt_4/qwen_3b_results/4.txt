```python
def min_invitations(t):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # If there are more than 2 friends who don't need invitations, the answer is 2
        if sum(1 for pi in p if pi != p[pi-1]) > 2:
            results.append(2)
        else:
            results.append(3)
    return "\n".join(map(str, results))

t = int(input())
print(min_invitations(t))
```

This Python script reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case, and prints the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to come to the party. It checks if more than 2 friends do not need invitations (i.e., their best friend is themselves), and if so, returns 2 invitations. Otherwise, it returns 3 invitations.
