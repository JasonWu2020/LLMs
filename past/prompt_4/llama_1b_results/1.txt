Critique of the original solution:

The solution is a brute-force approach that tries all possible combinations of numbers from 1 to n, which is not an efficient solution for large values of n. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which can be optimized.

Another critique is that the solution does not consider the case where the sum of the two sets is equal to n. In such cases, the sets would be identical, and the GCD would be 1.

Here's a revised solution that addresses these issues:

```python
import math

def is_possible(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if math.gcd(i, j) > 1:
                return True
    return False

def print_partitions(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not is_possible(i):
            print("No")
            return
    print("Yes")
    partitions = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        partition = [i]
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if not is_possible(j):
                continue
            partition.append(j)
            partitions.append(' '.join(map(str, partition)))
    print('\n'.join(partitions))

n = int(input())
print_partitions(n)
```

This revised solution uses two nested loops to generate all possible combinations of numbers from 1 to n. It checks if the GCD of each pair of numbers is greater than 1, and if so, it prints "No". If it doesn't find any such pair, it prints "Yes" followed by the partitions that satisfy the condition.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is more efficient than the original solution for large values of n.
