Critique of the outputted solution:

The solution has a time complexity of O(m * n^2) due to the nested loops. This is not efficient for large inputs.

Another solution can be achieved using dynamic programming, which has a time complexity of O(m * n^2). The idea is to build a table to store the number of ways to reach each pair of stops.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = [0] * (n + 1)
t = [0] * (n + 1)
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    s1, s2 = map(int, input().split())
    s[s1] = 1
    t[s2] = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(i, n + 1):
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % 1000000007
for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1]
        dp[i][j] %= 1000000007
ans = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    ans += dp[n][i]
ans %= 1000000007
print(ans)
```

This solution works by building a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach stops `i` and `j`. It then calculates the number of ways to reach each pair of stops using the recurrence relation. Finally, it sums up the number of ways to reach the last stop and takes the result modulo 1000000007 to get the final answer.
