The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(n * m * a * b) due to the nested loops, which can be optimized.

Here's the critique:

- The solution is not correct because it does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum heights for all possible submatrices.
- The solution does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum heights for all possible submatrices.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
n, m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
g0, x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(n - a + 1):
    for j in range(m - b + 1):
        g = [0] * (m * n)
        for k in range(i * m + 1, (i + 1) * m):
            g[k] = g[k - i * m] + g0
        g = [0] * (m * n)
        for k in range(j * m + 1, (j + 1) * m):
            g[k] = min(g[k - j * m] + y, g[k])
        ans += sum(g)
print(ans)
```

This solution works by first initializing a 2D array `g` with zeros and calculating the sum of minimum heights for all possible submatrices. Then it iterates over all possible submatrices of size `(i, j)` and updates the `g` array accordingly. Finally, it sums up the minimum heights of all submatrices.
