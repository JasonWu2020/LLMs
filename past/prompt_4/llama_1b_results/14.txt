The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(n * m * log(n * m)) due to the BFS algorithm, which is not efficient for large inputs.

A better approach would be to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n * m). We can use a queue to keep track of the cells to visit and their corresponding levels.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = [input() for _ in range(n)]

def dfs(sx, sy, sx1, sy1, visited):
    q = [[sx, sy, 0]]
    visited[sx][sy] = True
    level = 0
    while q:
        x, y, level = q.pop(0)
        if x == sx1 and y == sy1:
            return level
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and s[nx][ny] == '.' and not visited[nx][ny]:
                q.append([nx, ny, level + 1])
                visited[nx][ny] = True

    return -1

sx, sy = n//2, m//2
visited = [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
level = dfs(sx, sy, sx, sy, visited)
print('Yes' if level!= -1 else 'No')
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * m), which is much more efficient for large inputs.
