Critique of the outputted solution:

1. The solution assumes that the input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the x and d values of a camel. However, the problem statement specifies that the input is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the x value and the second integer is the d value.

2. The solution uses a dictionary to store the positions of the camels and their corresponding spitting distances. However, the solution does not handle the case where a camel is spitting at the same distance twice.

3. The solution uses a set to store the positions of the camels and their corresponding spitting distances. However, the solution does not handle the case where a camel is spitting at the same distance twice.

4. The solution does not handle the case where a camel is spitting at the same position.

5. The solution does not handle the case where the input is not a list of two integers.

6. The solution does not handle the case where the input is an empty list.

7. The solution does not handle the case where the input list contains only one camel.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
n = int(input())
spits = {}
for _ in range(n):
    x, d = map(int, input().split())
    if (x, d) in spins:
        if len(spits[(x, d)] + 1) > 1:
            print('YES')
            break
    else:
        spins[(x, d)] = [_]
if len(spits[(x, d)] + 1) > 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This solution first checks if the camel is spitting at the same distance twice. If it is, it prints 'YES' and breaks the loop. If not, it adds the camel to the set and continues with the next camel.
