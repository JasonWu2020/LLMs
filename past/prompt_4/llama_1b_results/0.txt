Critique of the outputted solution:

The solution provided has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. This is not efficient for large inputs.

Another solution can be generated using a hash table to store the frequency of each character in the string and then using dynamic programming to find the maximum length of good subsequence.

Here is the new solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def max_length(s, k):
    n = len(s)
    alphabet = 26
    freq = Counter(s)
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(1, alphabet + 1):
        cur_freq = Counter()
        for j in range(n):
            if freq[s[j] == str(i)] > 0:
                cur_freq[s[j]] -= 1
                if cur_freq[s[j]] == 0:
                    del cur_freq[s[j]]
            max_length = max(max_length, j + cur_freq[i])
    return max_length

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
print(max_length(s, k))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than the previous solution.
