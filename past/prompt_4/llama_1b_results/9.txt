Critique:

The outputted solution is correct in terms of mathematical logic, but it does not handle the case when the number of candies at the end is less than 0. It should return 0 in this case.

Here's the critique and another solution:

Critique:
- The solution assumes that k is always greater than or equal to 1. This is not guaranteed, as it may be less than 1.
- The solution does not handle the case when the number of candies at the end is less than 0.

Another solution:
n, k = map(int, input().split())
if k <= 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(n - k)
