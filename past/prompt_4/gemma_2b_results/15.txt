## Critique of the Provided Solution

The provided solution, as you requested, produces a list of integers. 
However, the provided solution is not directly optimized to meet the input- output requirements. 

The lack of output formatting directly contradicts the specifications. 

Here is an improvement by addressing formatting and input/output format:


## Improved Solution

```python
n = int(input())
graph = []
for _ in range(n-1):
    graph.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

point = []
for _ in range(n):
    point.append([])
    for _ in range(n):
        point[_].append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    

def get_vertices(point):
  vertices = []

  for i in range(len(point)):
    for vertex  in range(len(point)):
      if graph[i][vertex] != 0:
        vertices.append(graph[i][vertex])

  return vertices

n = len(get_vertices(point))
print(n)

```



**Explanation of Changes**
- Output Format: The solution above prints the number of vertices, which aligns with the specifications.
- Input Handling: The code has been restructured to handle the graph by making a list as a 2D arrays of data.
- Improved Structure: The code focuses on producing the required output with clean formatting, aligning with the provided requirements.
