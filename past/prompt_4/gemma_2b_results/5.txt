## Critique of previous Solution:  

The provided code snippet implements a clever approach to efficiently solve the problem through dynamic programming.  Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses.  

**Strengths:**

* **Clarity:**  Code is highly readable and follows a logical structure.
* **Correctness:**  It follows the problem's constraints and correctly determines the minimum total cost for sorting.
* **Efficiency:** Uses dynamic programming with a memoization cache which helps reduce redundant calculations, improving performance, especially for larger input. 


**Weaknesses:**
* **Incomplete Code Explanation:** The code provided is a clean solution to the problem but lacks detailed explanations that might be necessary for a beginner to grasp the underlying workings or a more detailed breakdown of the algorithm.
* **Oversimplification:** The explanation provided is basic but not complete.
* **Lack of Comments and Comments Format:**  It could benefit from better comments explaining each statement or function, improving maintainability and user understanding.



##  A More Compelling Solution 



```python
t = int(input())  
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    min_cost = 0
    n = len(s)  
    dp = [ [0]*(n+1)  for _ in range(n+1) ]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if s[i-1] == '0' and s[i-1] == '0':
            dp[i][0] = min(dp[i][0], dp[i-1][i-1])
        if s[i-1] == '0' and s[i-2] == '0':
            dp[i][i] =  min(dp[i][i], dp[i-1][i-1]+1)
        if s[i-1] == '1' and s[i-1] == '1':
            dp[i][0] = min(dp[i][0] , dp[i-1][0]) 
    print(dp[n][n-1])
```
