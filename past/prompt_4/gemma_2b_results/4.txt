The provided solution while conceptually correct does not provide a concrete and explicit breakdown of the logic. Here's a critique and an improved approach:


**Critique:**

* **Lack of Explicit Logic:** The solution seems to solve a  very specific edge case with brute force.
* **No Explanation of the Logic:** The reasoning is not explicit, leaving the code's working unclear. 

**Improved Approach:** 

 Here's a solution that adheres to the specifications while being more explicit:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    invitations = 0
    
    
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            send_to_friend = [i]
        else:
            send_to_friend = []
            
            for j in range(n):
                if p[j] == i:
                    if j in send_to_friend:
                        send_to_friend.append(j) 
                
        for to in send_to_friend:
            invitations += 1

            
    print(invitations) 
```



**Explanation:**
 1.  * **Input:** Take the test cases from the prompt.
 2.  * **Initialization:** Set `invitations` to 0 and iteratively iterate the array of friendship. 
 3. **Logic:** Iterate over friends. Each iteration through `i` represents the current friend, and each `p[i]` represents their bests friend.  The goal is to find a way to achieve at least 2 friends that can attend the party.
 4. **Output:** Return the total number of invitations at the end.

Let's refactor to address some of the issues of complexity:
