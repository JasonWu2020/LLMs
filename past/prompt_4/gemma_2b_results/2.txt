The first solution, while functional, has a couple of important flaws for this problem. The problem is structured differently than a simple sum computation, it involves a maximum value of a specific numeric difference; the code should adapt itself to compute an optimal solution for the problem that is given.

Here's a revised solution: 

```python
def calculate_diff(a, b):
  res = (sum(a) - sum(b))
  return max(0, res)


def main():
  n = int(input())
  a = list(map(int, input().split()))
  b = list(map(int, input().split()))
  
  ans = calculate_diff(a, b)
  print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Direct Calculation:** The code specifically calculates and handles the difference in scores using a dedicated `calculate_diff` function. This helps in a clearer understanding.
* **Max Function:** The function utilizes conditional operator `max` to maintain a valid difference output,  enforcing a valid difference between the scores.
