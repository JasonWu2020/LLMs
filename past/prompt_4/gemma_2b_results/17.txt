The provided solution has several issues: 

1. **Improper Input Handling** It doesn't account for potential edge cases.  It only reads data, but misses to provide a concrete understanding of the logic within the `get_minimum_time` function. 
2. **Readability**:  The code is hard to read and the output seems incorrect. 



Here's a revised solution to the provided format: 
```python
from math import gcd

# Get inputs from standard input
l, d, v, g, r = map(int, input().split())

# Determine the minimum time by counting the cycles of green and red light periods
t = 0

for _ in range(g * 2):        
    if  _ % (g * 2) == 0:
        t = g 

print(t) 
``` 




**Explanation**

* This version reads inputs as a number of inputs
* I've accounted for the fact that there are two types of light cycles which is determined by the variable _ 

Let me know if you'd like further refinement or explanations about the code!
