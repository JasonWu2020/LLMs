**Critique:**

The solution is well-written and efficient. It calculates the minimum height of the cell at position $(i, j)$ in the submatrix of size $a \times b$ with top left corner in $(i, j)$ using the formula $h_{i, j} = g_{(i - 1) \cdot m + j - 1}$. It then sums the minimum heights of the cells in the submatrix to get the total sum.

**Improvements:**

- **Reduce space complexity:** The solution currently uses a matrix `h` of size $n \times m$ to store the heights of the cells, which may not be necessary. Instead, we can use a prefix sum technique to store the cumulative sum of heights in a much smaller matrix of size $n - a + 1 \times m - b + 1$. This can reduce the space complexity by a factor of $m$.
- **Optimize time complexity:** The solution currently calculates the minimum height of the cell at position $(i, j)$ in the submatrix for each cell in the submatrix. This can be optimized by using a memoization technique to avoid redundant calculations.

**Enhanced Solution:**

```python
n, m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
g0, x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

h = [[int(g0) + (i - 1) * x + j - 1] for i in range(n) for j in range(m)]

s = 0
h_sum = 0
for i in range(n - a + 1):
    h_sum = 0
    for j in range(m - b + 1):
        min_h = min(h[i:i + a][j:j + b])
        h_sum += min_h
    s += h_sum

print(s)
```<eos>
