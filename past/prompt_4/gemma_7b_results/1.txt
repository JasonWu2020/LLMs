**Critique:**

The outputted solution is incorrect. It prints "Yes" followed by two lines, each containing the value of $n$ as the size and elements of both sets. This is not correct. The correct solution should print "Yes" followed by two lines, each containing the elements of the two sets.

**Corrected Solution:**

```python
n = int(input())

if n == 1:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
    print(n)
    print(str(n).split())
```

**Additional Observations:**

* The code reads the input and assigns it to the variable `n`.
* If `n` is 1, it prints "No" as there is no way to partition a single number into two non-empty sets.
* Otherwise, it prints "Yes" and the two lines describing the sets.
* The `str(n).split()` method is used to convert the integer `n` into a string and then split it into two equal parts, which represent the two sets.<eos>
