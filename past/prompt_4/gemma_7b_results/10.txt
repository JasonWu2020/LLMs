<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient. It reads the input, calculates the maximum height of two consecutive students from each row, and then finds the maximum height of the chosen students. The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of students in each row.

**Suggested improvements:**

- The solution could be improved by using a dictionary to store the maximum height of the two consecutive students from each row, so that the maximum height of the chosen students can be found in constant time.
- The solution could also be improved by using a suffix tree to store the maximum height of the two consecutive students from each row, so that the maximum height of the chosen students can be found in logarithmic time.

**Enhanced solution:**

```python3.8

n = int(input())
h1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
h2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

h_max = 0
h_dict = {}
for i in range(n):
    h_max = max(h_max, h1[i] + h2[i])
    h_dict[i] = max(h_dict.get(i-1, 0), h1[i])
    h_dict[i] = max(h_dict[i], h2[i])

print(h_max) 
```<eos>
