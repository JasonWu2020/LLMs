<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution provided above is correct, but it can be improved. The code reads the input and calculates the coordinates of vectors
A
,
B
, and
C
, but it does not check if the vector
B
can actually be obtained from vector
A
by performing the operations permitted by the teacher.

**Improved solution:**

```python3.8

x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())

a = (x1, y1)
b = (x2, y2)
c = (x3, y3)

if (x2 - x1) * y3 - (y2 - y1) * x3 == 0 and (x2 - x1) * y3 - (y2 - y1) * x3 > 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

```

**Explanation:**

The improved solution checks if the coordinates of vector
B
can be obtained by performing the operations permitted by the teacher. It first calculates the cross product of vectors
A
and
C
. If the cross product is zero, then it means that vector
B
can be obtained by performing the operations permitted by the teacher. If the cross product is not zero, then it means that it is not possible to get vector
B
out of vector
A
.<eos>
