**Critique:**

The solution is well-written and efficient. It calculates character frequencies, sorts characters by frequency, and then strategically deletes characters until the total number of characters deleted is less than or equal to *k*. The use of a dictionary to store character frequencies is an effective way to manage character data.

**Improvements:**

1. **Use a set to store distinct characters:** Instead of using a dictionary to store character frequencies, a set can be used to store distinct characters. This will reduce the time complexity of finding the distinct characters.
2. **Use a cumulative sum to track the total number of characters deleted:** Instead of iterating over the sorted characters to count the total number of characters deleted, a cumulative sum can be used to track the total number of characters deleted.

**Modified solution:**

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input().lower()

# Calculate character frequencies
char_set = set(s)
total_chars_deleted = 0
distinct_chars_remaining = len(char_set)

# Use a cumulative sum to track the total number of characters deleted
cumulative_sum = 0
for char in sorted(char_set, key=lambda char: -s.count(char)):
    cumulative_sum += s.count(char)
    if cumulative_sum <= k:
        total_chars_deleted += s.count(char)
        s = s.replace(char, "")

# Print the number of distinct characters and the resulting string
print(distinct_chars_remaining)
print(s)
```<eos>
