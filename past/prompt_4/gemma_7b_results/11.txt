**Critique:**

The above solution is concise and efficient. It reads the input, finds the maximum height of the first student in each row, and then finds the maximum of those heights to output the answer.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
n = int(input())
h1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
h2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
h_max = max(h1)
h_max = max(h_max, max(h2))
print(h_max)
```

This solution is even more concise and efficient compared to the previous solution. It reads the input, finds the maximum height of the first student in each row, and then finds the maximum of those heights to output the answer. However, it does not require the use of the variable `h_max` in the previous solution.<eos>
