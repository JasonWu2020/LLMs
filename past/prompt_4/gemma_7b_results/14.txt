<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution above is concise and efficient, but it does not handle the special case where the little boy is standing at a corner cell and is trapped by the walls. This is because the solution does not check if the position of the little boy is a corner cell.

**Improved solution:**

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
maze = []
for _ in range(n):
    maze.append(list(input().strip().split()))

x, y = map(int, input().split())

# Check if the cell (x, y) is a wall or a corner cell
if maze[x][y] == '#':
    print('No')
elif (x == 0 or y == 0) and maze[0][y] == '#':
    print('No')
else:
    print('Yes')
```<eos>
