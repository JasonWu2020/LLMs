**Critique:**

The solution above is efficient in terms of time complexity, but it has a space complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the array. This is because the memoization table stores all of the intermediate calculations, which can be space-consuming for large arrays.

**Improved solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    memo = {}
    for i in range(n):
        memo[i] = float('inf')
    memo[0] = a[0]

    for i in range(1, n):
        memo[i] = min(memo[i-1], a[i]) + a[i]

    print(min(memo[-1], sum(a)) - k * a[0])
```

This solution calculates the minimum possible total sum by considering the following two factors:

* The current sum of the array.
* The number of operations remaining.

However, it does not store all of the intermediate calculations in the memoization table. Instead, it only stores the minimum possible total sum at each position. This reduces the space complexity to O(n).

**Time complexity:**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the array. This is because we iterate over the array only once.

**Space complexity:**

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the array. This is because the memoization table stores only the minimum possible total sum at each position.<eos>
