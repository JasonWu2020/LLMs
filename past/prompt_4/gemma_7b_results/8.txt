**Critique:**

The solution is well-structured and efficient. It reads the input data, calculates the maximum number of sets, and then subtracts 1 if $n$ is odd. The code is concise and straightforward.

**Improved solution:**

```python3.8

n, k = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().splitlines()))

maxStudents = int(np.ceil(n/2)) * 2 - 1 if n % 2 else int(np.ceil(n/2)) * 2

print(maxStudents)

```

**Improvements:**

* The code is more concise and efficient as it eliminates the need to allocate portions for each drink type separately.
* The code uses the `np.ceil` function to round up the $\frac{n}{2}$ value.
* The code prints the result directly without any additional calculations or formatting.<eos>
