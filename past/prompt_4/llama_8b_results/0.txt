The outputted solution has the following issues:

1.  It uses a priority queue to store the frequency of each letter, which is not necessary. The problem can be solved using a more straightforward approach.

2.  The solution does not handle the case where the input string contains duplicate letters. It uses a priority queue to store the frequency of each letter, but it does not update the frequency correctly when it encounters duplicate letters.

3.  The solution does not handle the case where the input string contains letters that are not in the first k letters of the alphabet. It assumes that all letters in the string are in the first k letters of the alphabet, but it does not check for this condition.

Here is another solution that addresses these issues:

```python
input = __import__('sys').stdin.readline

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input().strip()

    cnt = [0] * k
    for c in s:
        if ord('A') <= ord(c) <= ord('A') + k - 1:
            cnt[ord(c) - ord('A')] += 1

    ans = min(cnt)
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, cnt[i])

    print(ans)

main()
```

This solution first counts the frequency of each letter in the string. It then finds the minimum frequency among all letters. The minimum frequency represents the length of the longest good subsequence. This solution is more straightforward and efficient than the previous one.
