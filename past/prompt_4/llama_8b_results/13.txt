The outputted solution has a few potential issues:

1. It does not handle the case where the input string is empty. In this case, it will raise an error when trying to access the first character of the string.
2. It does not handle the case where the input string contains non-alphabetical characters. In this case, it will raise an error when trying to compare a non-alphabetical character with the last character in the result.
3. It does not handle the case where the input string contains duplicate characters. In this case, it will append all duplicate characters to the result, which may not be the desired behavior.

Here's an alternative solution that addresses these issues:

```python
s = input()
result = ""
last = None
for c in s:
    if c.isalpha() and (not result or c > result[-1]):
        result += c
        last = c
print(result)
```

This solution checks if the current character is alphabetical before comparing it with the last character in the result. It also checks if the result is not empty before trying to access its last character. If the current character is alphabetical and is greater than the last character in the result, it appends the current character to the result. This ensures that the result contains the lexicographically maximum subsequence of the input string.
