**Critique of the outputted solution:**

The solution is mostly correct, but it can be improved for better readability and efficiency. Here are some suggestions:

1.  **Variable naming:** The variable names `first_k` and `length` are not very descriptive. Consider using more descriptive names like `repeating_pattern` and `pattern_length`.
2.  **Magic numbers:** The solution uses magic numbers like `k` and `n`. Consider defining these variables as constants or using more descriptive names.
3.  **Code organization:** The solution mixes the logic for finding the repeating pattern and constructing the beautiful integer. Consider separating these into different functions for better modularity.
4.  **Error handling:** The solution assumes that the input is always valid. Consider adding error handling to handle cases where the input is invalid.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
def find_repeating_pattern(s, k):
    for i in range(1, k):
        if s[:i] == s[i:i+k]:
            return s[:i]
    return s[:k]

def construct_beautiful_integer(s, k, repeating_pattern):
    max_length = len(s) - (len(s) % k)
    beautiful_integer = repeating_pattern * (len(s) // k) + repeating_pattern[:len(s) % k]
    return beautiful_integer

def solve(n, k, s):
    repeating_pattern = find_repeating_pattern(s, k)
    beautiful_integer = construct_beautiful_integer(s, k, repeating_pattern)
    return len(beautiful_integer), beautiful_integer

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

length, beautiful_integer = solve(n, k, s)

print(length)
print(beautiful_integer)
```

This solution is more modular and easier to read. It separates the logic for finding the repeating pattern and constructing the beautiful integer into different functions. It also uses more descriptive variable names and avoids magic numbers.
