The outputted solution is concise and directly calculates the number of candies Alya ate. However, it may not be immediately clear to readers how it was derived. Here's a critique:

1. The solution assumes that readers are familiar with the mathematical derivation provided earlier. If not, they may struggle to understand the code.
2. The use of the `//` operator for integer division may not be immediately clear, especially for readers unfamiliar with Python.

To address these concerns, here's an alternative solution that provides more context and clarity:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the total number of moves minus 1 (since the first move is always adding 1 candy)
moves_without_first_move = n - 1

# Calculate the number of candies Alya ate
candies_ate = (moves_without_first_move * (moves_without_first_move + 1)) // 2 - k + 1

print(candies_ate)
```

This solution breaks down the calculation into smaller, more manageable steps, making it easier for readers to understand. It also uses the `//` operator explicitly, making it clear that integer division is intended.
