The outputted solution has a few issues:

1. The solution modifies the dp array in a way that it's not necessary. The dp array is initialized with zeros, and then it's updated in a way that it's eventually filled with zeros, except for the last element. This can be simplified by just keeping track of the number of ways to reach the school.

2. The solution doesn't handle the case where a bus stop is not reachable. In this case, the solution will try to access dp[i] which is out of bounds, resulting in an IndexError. This can be handled by checking if the bus stop is reachable before trying to access dp[i].

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

n, m = map(int, input().split())
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[0] = 1

for _ in range(m):
    s, t = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(t - 1, s - 1, -1):
        if dp[i]!= 0:
            dp[t] = (dp[t] + dp[i]) % 1000000007
            dp[i] = 0

print(dp[n])
```

This solution initializes dp with zeros and then updates dp[t] whenever it finds a bus stop i that is reachable. If a bus stop is not reachable, it simply skips it. This way, the solution avoids the unnecessary updates to the dp array and the potential IndexError.
