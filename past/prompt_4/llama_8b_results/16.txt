The outputted solution has a few issues:

1.  It doesn't handle the case where a camel can spit at the previous or next camel. For example, if a camel is at position 0 and spits 10 units to the right, it can hit a camel at position -10. However, the current solution doesn't check for this case.
2.  It doesn't handle the case where a camel can spit at the previous camel and the next camel. For example, if a camel is at position 0 and spits 10 units to the right, it can hit a camel at position 10, and if there's another camel at position 20, it can spit at the first camel. However, the current solution doesn't check for this case.
3.  It doesn't handle the case where the first camel can spit at the last camel. For example, if there are two camels at positions 0 and 100, and the first camel spits 100 units to the right, it can hit the second camel. However, the current solution doesn't check for this case.

Here's another solution that addresses these issues:

```python
n = int(input())
x = []
d = []
for i in range(n):
    xi, di = map(int, input().split())
    x.append(xi)
    d.append(di)
x.sort()
for i in range(n):
    if i!= 0 and x[i] - d[i] <= x[i - 1]:
        left = x[i] - d[i]
        right = x[i] + d[i]
        if left <= x[i - 1] and right >= x[i - 1]:
            print("YES")
            exit()
    if i!= n - 1 and x[i] + d[i] >= x[i + 1]:
        left = x[i] - d[i + 1]
        right = x[i] + d[i + 1]
        if left <= x[i + 1] and right >= x[i + 1]:
            print("YES")
            exit()
    if i!= 0 and i!= n - 1 and x[i] - d[i] <= x[i - 1] and x[i] + d[i] >= x[i + 1]:
        print("YES")
        exit()
print("NO")
```

This solution checks all possible cases where a camel can spit at another camel, including the case where a camel can spit at the previous camel, the next camel, or both.
