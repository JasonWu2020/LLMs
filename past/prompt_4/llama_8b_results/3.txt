The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the use of the heap data structure. However, it can be optimized to O(n) by using a different approach.

The current solution uses a heap to store the values of the slimes that have not been eaten yet. It then iterates through the list of slimes from left to right, pushing each slime onto the heap if it is smaller than the top of the heap. However, this approach is not optimal because it does not take into account the values of the slimes that have already been eaten.

A better approach is to use a single pass through the list of slimes from left to right. For each slime, we check if it can eat the slime to its right. If it can, we subtract the value of the slime to its right from the value of the slime and continue to the next slime. If it cannot eat the slime to its right, we add the value of the slime to a running total. The running total is the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Here is another solution adhering to the same input and output specifications:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
total = 0
for i in range(n):
    if i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]:
        total += a[i]
    else:
        total = a[i]
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        total = a[i - 1] - a[i]
        break
print(total)
```
