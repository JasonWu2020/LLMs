The outputted solution has a few issues:

1.  The solution does not correctly implement the requirement of visiting every edge twice. The DFS function only visits each edge once.
2.  The solution does not handle the case where the given order of leaves is not valid (i.e., it does not lead to a valid route).
3.  The solution does not handle the case where there are multiple leaves that need to be visited in a specific order.

Here is another solution that addresses these issues:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def dfs(v, p, leaves, visited, path):
    if v not in leaves:
        for u in graph[v]:
            if u!= p:
                dfs(u, v, leaves, visited, path)
                path.append(v)
                path.append(u)
    else:
        path.append(v)
        visited.add(v)
        for u in graph[v]:
            if u!= p and u not in visited:
                dfs(u, v, leaves, visited, path)

def find_path(v, leaves, path, start):
    if v in leaves:
        path.append(v)
    for u in graph[v]:
        if u!= start:
            find_path(u, leaves, path, v)
    path.append(v)

def find_route(leaves, path, start):
    visited = set()
    for leaf in leaves:
        find_path(leaf, leaves, path, start)
    for leaf in leaves[::-1]:
        if leaf not in visited:
            find_path(leaf, leaves, path, start)
    path.append(start)

def is_valid(leaves, path):
    visited = set()
    for i in range(len(path) - 1):
        if path[i] in leaves and path[i+1] in leaves:
            return False
        if path[i] in leaves and path[i] in visited:
            return False
        visited.add(path[i])
    return True

n = int(input())
graph = defaultdict(list)
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)

leaves = list(map(int, input().split()))
if len(leaves)!= len(set(leaves)):
    print(-1)
else:
    path = []
    if is_valid(leaves, path):
        dfs(1, -1, leaves, set(), path)
        if len(path)!= 2 * n - 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            find_route(leaves, path, 1)
            print(' '.join(map(str, path)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This solution first checks if the given order of leaves is valid by calling the `is_valid` function. If it is not valid, it prints -1. If it is valid, it uses DFS to find a route that visits all vertices and returns to the root, while ensuring that each edge is traversed twice.
