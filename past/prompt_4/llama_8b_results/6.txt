The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step. However, it has a potential issue: it modifies the original array in place, which might not be desirable in some cases. 

A more Pythonic and efficient solution can be achieved by using a list comprehension to create a new sorted array without modifying the original array. Here's an alternative solution:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    min_sum = sum(a)
    for i in range(n - 1, n - k - 1, -1):
        min_sum -= a[i]
    print(min_sum)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, but it does not modify the original array. It works by summing up the entire array first, then subtracting the largest elements that cannot be replaced within the given number of operations.
