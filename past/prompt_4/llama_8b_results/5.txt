The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it makes two passes over the string to calculate the prefix sum array and then to calculate the answer.

However, the solution can be optimized further. The key insight is that the prefix sum array can be calculated in a single pass, and the answer can be calculated in another single pass. This is because the prefix sum array only needs to be calculated up to the point where the last '1' is seen, and the answer can be calculated by iterating over the string from the beginning to the point where the first '0' is seen.

Here is an optimized solution:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def solve():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    a = 0
    i = n
    while i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '0':
        i -= 1
    for j in range(i, 0, -1):
        a = max(a, s[j - 1] == '1' and j - a or 0)
    b = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if s[j] == '0':
            b = max(b, a)
        else:
            a = max(a, b)
    print(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```

This solution has the same time complexity as the previous one, but it is more concise and easier to understand. It also avoids the need to calculate the prefix sum array up to the end of the string, which can be beneficial for large inputs.
