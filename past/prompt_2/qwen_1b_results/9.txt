```python3
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce
from collections import deque

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 0:
        if k >= n + 1:
            k -= n + 1
            ans += n + 1
        else:
            ans += k
            break
        n -= 1
    
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the total number of moves and the number of candies in the box at the end, respectively. It calculates the number of candies Alya ate based on these inputs and prints the result.
