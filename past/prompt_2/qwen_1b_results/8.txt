```python3
import sys

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    favorites = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Calculate the optimal distribution of sets
    max_students = -1
    for i in range(1 << n):
        count = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if i & (1 << j):
                count += favorites[j] == i >> j & 1
        max_students = max(max_students, count)

    print(max_students)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python program reads inputs `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing each student's favorite drink type. It calculates the maximum number of students who can get their favorite drink by distributing the sets optimally and prints the result accordingly.
