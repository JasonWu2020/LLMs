This Python program reads five integers representing the distance between points A and B, the distance from A to the traffic lights, the car's speed, the duration of the green light, and the duration of the red light. It then calculates the minimum time required for the car to travel from point A to point B without violating the traffic rules and prints the result according to the specified format.
