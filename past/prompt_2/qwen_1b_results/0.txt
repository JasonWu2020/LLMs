This Python program reads the input values `n` and `k`, followed by the string `s`. It then counts the frequency of each letter in the first `k` letters of the string and checks every possible combination of `1`s and `0`s in binary representation of numbers up to `2^k` to find the longest sequence where all letters appear with equal frequency. The result is printed out.
