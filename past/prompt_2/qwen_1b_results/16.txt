```python3
import sys

def find_camel_spit():
    n = int(input().strip())
    positions = []
    directions = []

    # Read input and store positions and directions
    for _ in range(n):
        x, d = map(int, input().strip().split())
        positions.append(x)
        directions.append(d)

    # Check if there exist two camels who spat at each other
    for i in range(len(positions)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(positions)):
            if abs(positions[i] - positions[j]) == abs(directions[i]) + abs(directions[j]):
                return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

# Print the result
print(find_camel_spit())
```

This Python script reads the number of camels from standard input, followed by their positions and directions of spitting. It then checks all pairs of camels to see if they have spat at each other based on the given conditions. If it finds any pair meeting these criteria, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
