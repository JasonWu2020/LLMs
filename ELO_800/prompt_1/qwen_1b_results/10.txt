```python
# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate maximum number of days with different socks
max_diff_days = min(a, b)

# Calculate remaining socks after max_diff_days
remaining_red = a - max_diff_days
remaining_blue = b - max_diff_days

# Calculate minimum number of days with the same socks
min_same_days = min(remaining_red, remaining_blue) // 2

# Print result
print(max_diff_days, min_same_days)
```
