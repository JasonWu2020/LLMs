```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a > 0 and b >= 2 and c >= 2:
        print(a + b + c - 3)
    elif a > 0 and b >= 1 and c >= 2:
        print(a + b + c - 2)
    elif a > 0 and b == 0 and c >= 2:
        print(a + c - 1)
    elif a > 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:
        print(0)
    elif b > 0 and c == 0:
        print(a)
    elif b > 0 and c == 0:
        print(a + 1)
    else:
        print(0)
