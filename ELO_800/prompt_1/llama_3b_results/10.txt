```python
# Read the input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize variables
max_days = min(a, b)
remaining_red = a - max_days
remaining_blue = b - max_days

# Calculate days with different socks
different_days = max_days

# Calculate days with same socks
while remaining_red > 0 and remaining_blue > 0:
    remaining_red -= 1
    remaining_blue -= 1
    different_days += 1

# Calculate total days
total_days = different_days + remaining_red + remaining_blue

# Print the result
print(different_days, total_days)
```
