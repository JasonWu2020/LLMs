```python
s = input()
h = input()
h = [input() for _ in range(5)]
s = [input() for _ in range(5)]
for i in range(5):
    if h[i] == s[0]:
        if h[i] in h:
            print("YES")
            exit()
    if h[i][1] == s[0][1]:
        if h[i] in h:
            print("YES")
            exit()
print("NO")
```

This code reads the input from the user and checks if a card can be played by iterating over each card in the hand and the card on the table. If a card can be played, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
