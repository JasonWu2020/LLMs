```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    q, r = divmod(a, b)
    
    if r == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(b - r)
```
This Python script takes advantage of the `divmod` function, which returns both the quotient and remainder when dividing the first argument by the second. If there's no remainder, it means `a` is already divisible by `b`, so the answer is zero. Otherwise, it calculates how many additional increments (`b - r`) are needed to make `a` divisible by `b`.
