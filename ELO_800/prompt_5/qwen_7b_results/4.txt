```python
def decrypt_string(s):
    decrypted = []
    for char in s:
        if decrypted and char == decrypted[-1]:
            decrypted.pop()
        else:
            decrypted.append(char)
    return ''.join(decrypted)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        result = decrypt_string(s)
        print(result)
```

This Python script reads a number of test cases `t`, processes each case by reading the length `n` of the encrypted string and then the encrypted string itself. It decrypts the string using the specified method (`decrypt_string`) and prints the decrypted result for each case. The `decrypt_string` function works by iterating through the encrypted string, removing the last character from the `decrypted` list whenever it encounters a character that matches the last one in the list (indicating that the pair has been fully processed).
