```python
def min_invitations(n, p):
    friends = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        friends[p[i - 1]] = 1

    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if friends[i] == 1:
            count += 1
        if count >= 2:
            return count

    return count + 1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_invitations(n, p))
```

This script first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of friends and the best friends of each friend. It then initializes a list to keep track of which friends have been invited. It iterates over the best friends and increments the count if the friend has been invited. If at least two friends have been invited, it returns the count. If not, it returns the count plus one, because at least one more friend must be invited to meet the condition.
