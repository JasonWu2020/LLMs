```python
# Read the number of test cases
num_test_cases = int(input())

for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    # Read two integers a and b
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the remainder of a divided by b
    remainder = a % b

    # If the remainder is 0, then a is already divisible by b
    if remainder == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves needed
        # This is done by subtracting the remainder from b and adding 1
        # The subtraction gives the number of moves needed to make a divisible by b
        # The addition of 1 is to account for the current value of a
        min_moves = (b - remainder) + 1

        # Print the result
        print(min_moves)
```

This code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and prints the minimum number of moves needed to make `a` divisible by `b`.
