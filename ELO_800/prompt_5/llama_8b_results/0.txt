```python
from collections import defaultdict

def solve():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for c in s:
        count[c] += 1

    min_count = float('inf')
    for key in count:
        min_count = min(min_count, count[key])
    for key in count:
        if count[key] < min_count:
            return 0
    return min_count * k

print(solve())
```

This script first reads the length of the string `n` and the number of unique characters `k` from the input, then reads the string `s`. It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each character in the string. Then it finds the minimum count of any character, which is the maximum length of the good subsequence. If there is a character with a count less than the minimum count, it returns 0, because a good subsequence cannot be formed. Otherwise, it returns the minimum count times `k`, which is the length of the longest good subsequence.
