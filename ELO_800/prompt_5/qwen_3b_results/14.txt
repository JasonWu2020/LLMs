Here's the Python code that solves the problem based on the specifications provided:

```python
def process_array(a, k):
    max_value = max(a)
    
    for _ in range(k):
        # Update max_value if necessary (though it won't change for this problem)
        max_value = max(max_value, *a)
        
        # Perform the operation: replace each element with d - a_i
        a = [max_value - x for x in a]
    
    return a

# Read input
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().strip().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    
    # Process the array
    result = process_array(a, k)
    
    # Print the result
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

```

### Explanation:
1. **Process Array Function**: 
   - This function takes an array `a` and an integer `k`.
   - It finds the maximum value in the array initially.
   - For each of the `k` operations, it updates the array by replacing each element `a_i` with `max_value - a_i`.
   
2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the initial elements of the array `a`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It calls the `process_array` function for each test case.
   - It prints the resulting array after applying the specified operations.

This code handles the problem efficiently by leveraging the fact that the maximum value in the array remains constant throughout the operations, simplifying the calculation significantly.
