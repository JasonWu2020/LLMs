This Python script defines a function `max_days` that calculates the maximum number of days Vasya can wear different-colored socks and the number of days he can wear the same-colored socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got. The input is taken from standard input, and the result is printed to standard output.
