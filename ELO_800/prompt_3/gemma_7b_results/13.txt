**Critique:**

The solution is well-written, but it can be improved.

**Critique:**

* The code is correct, but it can be made more efficient.
* The code does not handle the case where the input array is sorted in descending order.
* The code does not handle the case where the input array is constant.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    l = len(a)
    for i in range(l-1):
        if a[i] != a[i+1]:
            a[i:i+2] = [a[i] + a[i+1]]
            l -= 1
    print(l)

```<eos>
