**Critique:**

The above solution reads the input, determines the values of $n$, $a$, and $b$, and checks if the conditions for the existence of two permutations satisfying the given conditions are met. If the conditions are met, it prints " Yes ", otherwise, it prints " No ".

**Solution:**

```python3.8
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

    if a + b <= n and a + b >= 2:
        print(" Yes ")
    else:
        print(" No ")
```

**Improvements:**

- The above solution checks if the sum of $a$ and $b$ is less than or equal to $n$ and greater than or equal to 2. This is necessary and sufficient for the existence of two permutations satisfying the given conditions.
- The solution could be improved by checking if the sum of $a$ and $b$ is exactly equal to $n$. This would ensure that the two permutations have the longest common prefix and suffix of the specified lengths.
- The solution could also be improved by checking if the sum of $a$ and $b$ is greater than $n$. This would ensure that the two permutations do not exist.

**Revised Solution:**

```python3.8
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

    if a + b <= n and a + b >= 2 and a + b == n:
        print(" Yes ")
    else:
        print(" No ")
```<eos>
