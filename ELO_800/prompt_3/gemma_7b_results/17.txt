**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient, but it can be improved. The code calculates the difference between the lock and the combination for each disk separately, which is unnecessary. Instead, it can calculate the difference between the lock and the combination for each disk in one pass, using a dictionary to store the differences.

**Improved solution:**

```python3.8
n = int(input())
lock = list(map(int, input().split()))
combination = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the difference between the lock and the combination in one pass
differences = {x: abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(lock, combination)}

# Print the minimum number of moves
print(sum(differences.values()))
```

**Output:**

```
13
```

**Improved solution output:**

```
13
```<eos>
