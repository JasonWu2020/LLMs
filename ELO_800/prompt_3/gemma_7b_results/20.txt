<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution is correct, but it can be improved. The code is iterating over the range `1` to `n` to find the maximum value of `k`. This is inefficient, as the loop iterates over unnecessary elements.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = 0
    while n & (n-1):
        n &= n-1
        k += 1
    print(k)
```<eos>
