**Critique:**

The solution reads the input for the number of test cases, then iterates over each test case, reading the input for the integer $n$, and finding the maximum value of $k$ that satisfies the condition. The solution uses a while loop to iterate over the values of $k$, and checks if the bitwise AND of $n$ and $n-k$ is 0. If it is, the value of $k$ is updated, and the loop continues. Finally, the value of $k$ is printed.

**Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    while n & (n-k):
        n &= n-k
        k += 1
    print(k)
```<eos>
