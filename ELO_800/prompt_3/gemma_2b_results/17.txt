The provided solution is an attempt to directly implement the problem. However, it's important to note that this solution does not precisely solve the problem. Due to the constraint of an integer value representing the digits on a disk, the logic of the provided code leads to incorrect outputs for more complex scenarios.

Here's a revised solution that uses a strategy that better addresses the provided problem:

```python
def solve(n, original, target):
    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)] 
    
    for i in range(10):
        dp[i][0] = 0
  
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(10):
            if str(i[0]) == str(j) and dp[j][i] is not None:
                
                dp[j][i] += 1
    return dp
    

n = int(input())
original = list(map(int, input().split()))
target = int(input())

moves = solve(n, original, target)
print(moves) 

```


**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(n, original, target)`:** 
   * **Initialization:** 
   -  **`dp = [[-1 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]`**: A 2D array  `dp` is initialized. This array's dimensions are `10` x `10` which is an array with 10 rows and 10 columns. Each element is initialized with -1.
   * **Base Case:**
     - `for i in range(10): dp[i][0] = 0`: We initialize the first row (`i =0`) and the first column `0` to 0. 
  2.  
   * **Dynamic Programming:** The logic of the code assumes a strategy that can be explored, but it needs additional details and a more complex approach to handle a sequence of disk changes and determine the minimum number of turns.


**Further Improvements:**
- **Input Handling:**  Consider checking for valid input ranges for `n` and `target`.
- **Clarity:** A docstring would further improve the readability of the code and clarify its functionality.
- **Optimizations:**  For larger values of `n`, dynamic programming can introduce significant complexity and computational overhead.  A more optimized approach if necessary is to explore a more efficient brute force algorithm that iterates through all possible moves.
