The outputted solution has several issues:

1. It does not handle the case when the string S does not contain the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'. In this case, it should output the original string S.
2. It does not handle the case when the string S contains more than one character 'a', 'b', or 'c'. In this case, it should output the lexicographically smallest permutation of S that does not contain 'abc' as a subsequence.
3. It uses a list to count the frequency of each character in the string S, which is not necessary. It can simply count the frequency of each character directly.
4. It does not use a more efficient way to generate the lexicographically smallest permutation of S.

Here is a revised solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    t = input()
    cnt = [0] * 26
    for c in s:
        cnt[ord(c) - 97] += 1
    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:
        print(s)
        continue
    if cnt[0] == 0 or cnt[1] == 0 or cnt[2] == 0:
        print(''.join('abc' * (min(cnt[0], min(cnt[1], cnt[2])))))
        continue
    if cnt[0] >= 1 and cnt[1] >= 1 and cnt[2] >= 1 and 'a' in t and 'b' in t and 'c' in t:
        for i in range(26):
            if i!= 0 and i!= 1 and i!= 2:
                cnt[i] = 1
    s = ''
    for i in range(26):
        if i == 0 and cnt[i] >= 1:
            s += 'a' * cnt[i]
        if i == 1 and cnt[i] >= 1:
            s += 'b' * cnt[i]
        if i == 2 and cnt[i] >= 1:
            s += 'c' * cnt[i]
    for i in range(26):
        if i!= 0 and i!= 1 and i!= 2:
            s += chr(i + 97) * cnt[i]
    print(s)
```

This revised solution addresses the issues mentioned above and generates the lexicographically smallest permutation of S that does not contain 'abc' as a subsequence.
