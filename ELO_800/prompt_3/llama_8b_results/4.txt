**Critique of the outputted solution:**

The solution is generally correct and meets the requirements. However, it has a few minor issues:

1. The variable `t` is not necessary, as the number of test cases can be directly read from the input.
2. The variable `ans` can be replaced with a list comprehension for a more concise solution.
3. The `while` loop can be replaced with a `for` loop for a more Pythonic solution.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = [s[i] for i in range(n) if i % 2 == 0]
    print(''.join(ans))
```

This solution is more concise and Pythonic, and it achieves the same result as the original solution.
