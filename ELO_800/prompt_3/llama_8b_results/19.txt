The outputted solution has a time complexity of O(t * log(n)), where t is the number of test cases and n is the input number. This is because for each test case, it needs to calculate the bit length of the input number, which takes O(log(n)) time.

However, the solution can be improved by directly using the bit length of the input number minus one as the maximum value k, because if n has a certain bit set, it will be cleared in the bitwise AND operation with n-1, n-2, n-3,..., k. Therefore, the maximum value k will be n with the least significant bit cleared.

Here is an improved solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    while (n | k)!= n:
        k += 1
    print(k - 1)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(t * log(n)), which is the same as the original solution. However, it is more intuitive and easier to understand because it directly finds the maximum value k by checking whether the bitwise OR operation between n and k is equal to n. If not, it means the least significant bit of k is set, so it increments k until the least significant bit of k is cleared.
