The outputted solution has a few issues:

1. The `math.ceil` function is used to round up to the nearest integer, but it is not necessary in this case. The division `k * (10 - r) / (r * 10)` will already result in an integer, because `k` and `r` are integers and `10 - r` and `r * 10` are relatively prime.
2. The condition `if k % r == 0:` is not necessary. The problem statement already states that `1 <= r <= 9`, so `k % r` will always be non-zero.

Here is a revised solution:

```python
# Read the input
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the minimum number of shovels
ans = k * (10 - r) // (r * 10)

# If the result is 0, set it to 1
if ans == 0:
    ans = 1

# Print the result
print(ans)
```

However, we can simplify the solution further:

```python
# Read the input
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the minimum number of shovels
ans = (k * (10 - r) + r - 1) // (r * 10)

# Print the result
print(ans)
```

This solution uses the fact that `//` performs integer division, which will truncate the result to the nearest integer. We add `r - 1` to `k * (10 - r)` to make the numerator non-negative, and then perform the division. This ensures that the result is always an integer.
