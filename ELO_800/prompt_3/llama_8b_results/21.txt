The outputted solution is quite efficient and easy to understand. However, it has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sort operation, which might not be necessary in this case. A more efficient solution would be to use a hash set or a dictionary to keep track of the unique values, which would reduce the time complexity to O(n).

```python
from collections import defaultdict

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
unique_values = defaultdict(int)
for num in a:
    unique_values[num] += 1

pockets = 0
for count in unique_values.values():
    pockets = max(pockets, count)

print(pockets)
```

This solution works by counting the occurrences of each unique value in the input array and then finding the maximum count, which represents the minimum number of pockets needed.
