**Critique of the outputted solution:**

The solution provided is a direct implementation of the problem requirements. However, it has some issues:

1. The solution uses a lot of repeated code, which makes it harder to maintain and understand. For example, the code for printing the board in different cases is duplicated.
2. The solution does not follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. This makes it harder to modify the code in the future.
3. The solution does not handle the case where k is greater than n. It simply prints -1, but it would be better to raise an exception or return an error message.
4. The solution does not handle the case where k is less than 1. It assumes that k is always greater than or equal to 1.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k < 1 or k > n:
        print(-1)
    elif k == 1:
        print('\n'.join(['R' if i == n else '.' for i in range(1, n + 1)]))
    elif k == 2:
        if n == 2:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print('\n'.join(['.' for _ in range(n)] + ['R']))
            for i in range(1, n):
                print('R' if i == n - 1 else '.')
    elif k == n:
        print('\n'.join(['R' for _ in range(n)]))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This solution is more concise and easier to understand. It also handles the cases where k is less than 1 and greater than n. However, it still has some repeated code, which can be improved further.

**Improved solution:**

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k < 1 or k > n:
        print(-1)
    elif k == 1:
        print('\n'.join(['R' if i == n else '.' for i in range(1, n + 1)]))
    elif k == 2:
        if n == 2:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print('\n'.join(['.' for _ in range(n)] + ['R']))
            for i in range(1, n):
                print('R' if i == n - 1 else '.')
    elif k == n:
        print('\n'.join(['R' for _ in range(n)]))
    else:
        print('\n'.join(['.' for _ in range(n)]))
        for i in range(k):
            print('R', end='')
            for j in range(n - 1):
                print('.', end='')
            print()
```

This solution eliminates the repeated code by using a loop to print the board in the case where k is greater than 2.
