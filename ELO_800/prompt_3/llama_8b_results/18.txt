**Critique of the outputted solution**

The outputted solution has some potential issues:

1.  It does not handle the case when `a[i]` is not in `d`. In this case, `a[i]` should not be appended to `c` and `a[i]` and `b[d[a[i]]]` should not be set to 1001.
2.  It does not check if `d[a[i]]` is valid before accessing `b[d[a[i]]]`. If `d[a[i]]` is not a valid index, this will result in an `IndexError`.
3.  The solution assumes that the input arrays `a` and `b` are non-empty. It does not handle the case when either `a` or `b` is empty.

**Alternative solution**

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d = {}
    for i in range(m):
        d[b[i]] = i

    a.sort()
    b.sort()
    c = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < m:
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            c.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif a[i] < b[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1

    if len(c) == 0:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(c))
        print(*c)
```

This solution uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through `a` and `b` respectively. It checks if the current elements of `a` and `b` are equal, and if so, appends the element to `c`. If the current element of `a` is less than the current element of `b`, it increments `i`. Otherwise, it increments `j`. This solution handles the cases when `a[i]` is not in `d` and when `d[a[i]]` is not a valid index. It also handles the case when either `a` or `b` is empty.
