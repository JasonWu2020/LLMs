```python
def solve():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k > n * (n - 1):
        print(-1)
        return
    if k == 1:
        for i in range(n):
            print('R', end='')
        print()
        return
    a = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(k):
        a[i][0] = i + 1
    for i in range(n):
        a[i][k] = i + 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(k):
            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
                a[i][j] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(k):
            print(a[i][j], end='')
        print()

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```

Explanation of the critique:

1.  The original solution does not handle the case when `k` is greater than `n * (n - 1)`. In this case, the code will not print any output, which is not allowed. We need to add a condition to check if `k` is greater than `n * (n - 1)` and print `-1` in this case.

2.  The original solution uses two nested loops to iterate over the chessboard. This can be optimized by using a single loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the chessboard. We can use two nested loops to place the first `k` rooks on the board and then iterate over the remaining `n - k` positions to place the remaining `k` rooks.

3.  The original solution does not handle the case when there are more than `k` rooks. In this case, it prints `-1` and does not report that there is no stable arrangement. We need to add a check to report that there is no stable arrangement when `k` is greater than `n * (n - 1)`.

4.  The original solution uses two separate loops to print the chessboard. We can use a single loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the chessboard and prints the corresponding rooks.

5.  The original solution does not handle the case when `k` is 1. In this case, it prints the chessboard with a single row of `R`s. We need to add a special case to handle this scenario.

6.  The original solution does not handle the case when `k` is less than or equal to `n`. We need to add a check to report that there is no stable arrangement when `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
