```python
def solve():
    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        print(max(0, b - (a % b)))

solve()
```

Critique:
- The code is well-structured and easy to read.
- It uses clear and concise variable names.
- The logic is correct, it calculates the maximum possible number of moves required to make `a` divisible by `b`.
- However, the code does not handle cases where `a` is already divisible by `b`. It should return 0 in such cases.
