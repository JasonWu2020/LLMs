[/INST] The outputted solution is valid and works according to the problem statement. However, it could be optimized by using the loop condition to check if the current number of shovels is a multiple of (r + 1). Here's an optimized version:

```python
k, r = map(int, input().split())
shovels = 0
while (shovels * (r + 1) % (k * (r + 1)) != k * (r + 1)):
    shovels += 1
print(shovels)
```

This solution checks if the current number of shovels multiplied by (r + 1) is a multiple of k * (r + 1), which is the total amount of money in burles and 10-burle coins. If it is, then it means that the number of shovels bought is the minimum number required to pay for them without any change.

Another approach is to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of k and r+1, and then calculate the number of shovels based on the result. This approach is more complex and has a higher time complexity, so it is not recommended unless the input values are very large.

```python
import math

k, r = map(int, input().split())
gcd, x, y = 0, 1, 0
while r != 0:
    k, r = r, k % r
gcd = k
shovels = (k + r) // k * (k // (r + 1))
print(int(shovels))
```</s>
