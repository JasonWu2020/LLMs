[/INST] The solution provided above is a valid Python 3.8 code that reads the input and prints the output according to the given problem statement. However, there are some improvements that could be made to make the code more concise and efficient:

```python
# Version 1: Using a set to store friends and their best friends
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    friends = set(map(int, input().split()))
    min_invitations = len(friends) // 2 if len(friends) % 2 else len(friends) // 2 + 1
    print(min_invitations)

# Version 2: Using a dictionary to store friends and their best friends
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    friends = {i: int(i) for i in input().split()}
    min_invitations = len(set(friends.values())) // 2 if len(friends) % 2 else len(set(friends.values())) // 2 + 1
    print(min_invitations)
```

Both versions use the same input and output specifications. The main difference between them is the way they store the input data. The first version uses a set to store friends, while the second version uses a dictionary to store friends and their best friends. The dictionary version is more memory-efficient since it allows constant time lookups and doesn't need to convert the input to a set before calculating the result. However, the set version is more concise and easier to understand for small input sizes.

Both versions have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) for the set version or O(1) for the dictionary version.</s>
