[/INST] The outputted solution seems to be incomplete as it does not include the necessary imports and the function `cyclic()` is not defined. Here is a complete solution:

```python
from itertools import cycle

n = int(input())
exercises = list(map(int, input().split()))
muscles = ["chest", "biceps", "back"]
muscle = muscles[sum(map(lambda x, ix: 1 if ix[0] % 3 == i else 0, enumerate(cycle(muscles))[:n])].index(max(exercises))
print(muscles[muscle])
```

This solution uses the `itertools.cycle()` function to create a cyclic iterator for the muscle types, and keeps track of the number of times each muscle type has been exercised in the current cycle using the index of the muscle type in the list `muscles`. The index of the muscle type with the maximum number of repetitions is then found and printed.</s>
