Critique of the Outputted Solution:

The outputted solution is generally correct but can be improved in several ways:

1.  The solution does not handle the case when the input arrays do not have any common elements. In this case, the output should be "NO" without any further processing.

2.  The solution does not handle the case when the input arrays have common elements but there is no subsequence that can be formed by taking elements from both arrays. In this case, the solution should also output "NO".

3.  The solution does not check for duplicate elements in the input arrays. This might not be a problem in this specific problem, but it's good practice to include this check in a general solution.

4.  The solution does not sort the input arrays before processing them. This can be done to make the solution more efficient.

5.  The solution does not handle the case when the input arrays are empty. This case should be explicitly handled.

Here's a revised solution that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys

def find_common_subsequence(a, b):
    a = sorted(set(a))  # Remove duplicates
    b = sorted(set(b))  # Remove duplicates

    if not a or not b:
        return None

    i = j = 0
    common = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            common.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif a[i] < b[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1

    if i == len(a) and j == len(b):
        return None

    return common

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

    result = find_common_subsequence(a, b)
    if result is None:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(result))
        print(*result)
```

This revised solution first removes duplicates from the input arrays, then sorts them. It then finds the common subsequence by iterating over the arrays and comparing elements. If a common subsequence is found, it is returned; otherwise, `None` is returned. The main part of the solution then prints the result according to the problem's requirements.
