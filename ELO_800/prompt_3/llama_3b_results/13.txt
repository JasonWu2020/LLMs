Critique of the provided solution:

* The solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for this problem.
* The space complexity is O(1), which is also optimal.
* The solution is easy to understand and implement.
* However, the variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `s` could be renamed to `sum_of_repeated_numbers`.
* The code could benefit from more comments to explain the logic behind the solution.

Here's an alternative solution with improved variable names and comments:

```python
```python
def find_shortest_password_length():
    # Read the number of test cases
    num_test_cases = int(input())

    # Iterate over each test case
    for _ in range(num_test_cases):
        # Read the length of the password
        password_length = int(input())

        # Read the password
        password = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Initialize a variable to store the sum of repeated numbers
        sum_of_repeated_numbers = 0

        # Initialize a variable to store the minimum password length
        min_password_length = password_length

        # Iterate over the password
        for i in range(password_length - 1):
            # If the current number is not equal to the next number
            if password[i]!= password[i + 1]:
                # Add the sum of the current number and the next number to the sum of repeated numbers
                sum_of_repeated_numbers += password[i] + password[i + 1]

                # Update the minimum password length
                min_password_length = min(min_password_length, password_length - (i + 1))

        # If the sum of repeated numbers is greater than the minimum password length
        if sum_of_repeated_numbers > min_password_length:
            # Update the minimum password length
            min_password_length = sum_of_repeated_numbers

        # Print the minimum password length
        print(min_password_length)

```
