**Critique of the Outputted Solution:**

The solution is well-structured and clear in its approach. It uses a visited array to keep track of the friends that have been processed and a variable to count the number of friends that have been invited. However, there are a few potential issues:

- The solution assumes that the input is valid and does not include any error checking. In a real-world scenario, you would want to add checks to ensure that the input is valid (e.g., non-negative integers, input size within the specified range).

- The solution does not include a clear and concise comment explaining the logic behind the algorithm.

- The variable `cnt` is not necessary and can be replaced with a more descriptive variable name, such as `num_friends_invited`.

- The solution does not handle the case where there are less than 2 friends. In this case, the solution should return an error message or a special value indicating that it is impossible to send invitations to at least 2 friends.

- The solution uses 0-based indexing, but the input uses 1-based indexing. This could lead to confusion and errors.

**Another Solution:**

```python
```python
import sys

def solve():
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them attend.
    """
    # Read the number of friends
    n = int(input())

    # Check if there are at least 2 friends
    if n < 2:
        print("Impossible to send invitations to at least 2 friends.")
        return

    # Read the friendships
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize a dictionary to store the friendships
    friendships = {i: p[i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1)}

    # Initialize a set to store the friends that have been invited
    invited_friends = set()

    # Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of invitations needed
    min_invitations = 0

    # Iterate over the friends
    for friend, best_friend in friendships.items():
        # If the friend has not been invited yet and the best friend has been invited
        if friend not in invited_friends and best_friend in invited_friends:
            # Mark the friend as invited
            invited_friends.add(friend)
            # Increment the minimum number of invitations needed
            min_invitations += 1

    # Print the minimum number of invitations needed
    print(min_invitations)

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Run the solution for each test case
for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```
