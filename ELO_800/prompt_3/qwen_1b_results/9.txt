### Critique of the Provided Solution

The provided Python script correctly implements the logic for determining which muscle will receive the most training based on the given exercise repetition counts. However, there are some minor improvements that could enhance its readability and maintainability:

1. **Error Handling**: The current implementation doesn't handle cases where `n` might exceed 20, even though this constraint isn't explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. It's good practice to validate inputs more robustly.
  
2. **Code Readability**: While the code itself is clear and straightforward, adding comments explaining key parts like the calculation process can make it easier for others to understand the logic.

Hereâ€™s an improved version with these considerations:

```python
def find_most_trained_muscle(n, repetitions):
    """
    Determine which muscle receives the most training based on the given exercise repetitions.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of exercises.
        repetitions (list[int]): List of integers representing how many times each exercise is repeated.

    Returns:
        str: "chest", "biceps", or "back".
    """

    # Validate input
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1 or n > 20:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for 'n'. Must be between 1 and 20.")

    max_exercise = max(repetitions)
    
    # Determine the muscle with the highest repetition count
    if max_repetition == repetitions[0]:
        return "chest"
    elif max_repetition == repetitions[1]:
        return "biceps"
    else:
        return "back"

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        n = int(input().strip())
        repetitions = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        result = find_most_trained_muscle(n, repetitions)
        print(result)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Validation of Input**:
   - Added validation checks to ensure `n` is within the valid range (`1 <= n <= 20`). If invalid values are entered, the function raises a `ValueError`.

2. **Enhanced Readability**:
   - Included comments to explain the flow of the program and specific sections of the algorithm.

3. **Improved Code Structure**:
   - Encapsulated the core functionality into a single function named `find_most_trained_muscle`.
   - Used a docstring to document the purpose, parameters, and return type of the function.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - Included example usage at the bottom to demonstrate how to call the function from within the main block.

This updated solution maintains the original functionality while improving its structure and clarity, making it easier to understand and modify in future iterations.
