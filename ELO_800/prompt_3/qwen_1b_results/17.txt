### Critique of Previous Solution:

The previous solution provided an incorrect approach to solving the problem. It did not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required to change the initial state of the disks to match the target combination. Instead, it simply counted the number of characters that differed between the two strings, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of moves needed.

### Corrected Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of moves that transforms the current state into the desired state. We can achieve this by iterating through each pair of corresponding disks and calculating the maximum absolute difference between their values. The sum of these differences gives us the total number of moves required.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this logic in Python:

```python
def min_moves_to_unlock(n, initialState, targetState):
    # Calculate the total number of moves required
    totalMoves = sum(abs(initial - target) for initial, target in zip(initialState, targetState))
    
    return totalMoves

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    initialState = input()
    targetState = input()
    
    result = min_moves_to_unlock(n, initialState, targetState)
    print(result)
```

This script reads the inputs `n`, `initialState`, and `targetState` from standard input. It calculates the total number of moves required using the formula mentioned above and prints out the result.
