Here's a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def find_max_k(t):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        k = n - 1
        while (k > 0) and ((n & k) != 0):
            k -= 1
        results.append(k)
    return results

t = int(input())
results = find_max_k(t)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases `t`, then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of `k` such that the bitwise AND operation between `n` and all integers from `n-1` down to `k` equals 0. It starts with `k=n-1` and decrements `k` until the condition fails. The results are printed for each test case. 

Please note that this solution works within the given constraints but may not be the most efficient one for large values of `n`. It involves checking every integer from `n-1` down to `k` which could be slow for very large inputs. However, it complies with the specified input and output formats.
