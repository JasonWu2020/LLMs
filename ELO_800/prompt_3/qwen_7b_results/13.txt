```python
def shortest_password_length(test_cases):
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        password = list(map(int, input().split()))
        unique_elements = set(password)

        # If all elements are identical, the minimum length would be 1
        if len(unique_elements) == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Otherwise, the minimum length is just the number of unique elements,
            # as we can always continue merging until we have only one element left
            print(len(unique_elements))


# Main program starts here
test_cases = int(input())  
shortest_password_length(test_cases)
```
This solution uses a slightly different approach than the previous one. It defines a function `shortest_password_length` that processes the input data and calculates the shortest possible length of the password based on the rules specified in the question. It uses a set to keep track of unique elements in the password. If there's more than one unique element, it means we can keep merging pairs until only one element remains, so the minimum length is the number of unique elements. Otherwise, if all elements are the same, the minimum length is 1.
