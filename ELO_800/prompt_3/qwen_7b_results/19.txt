# Python script to solve the problem.

import sys

def max_zero_and_value(n):
    """
    Finds the maximum integer k such that the bitwise AND operation between n, n-1, ..., k results in 0.
    """
    k = 0
    while True:
        n -= 1
        if n & (n - 1) == 0:
            return k + 1
        k += 1

def read_input(file):
    """
    Reads the number of test cases, followed by their corresponding integers.
    """
    t = int(next(file))
    return [(int(next(file)), max_zero_and_value(n)) for _ in range(t)]

def write_output(output):
    """
    Writes the output to standard output.
    """
    for res in output:
        print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("input.txt", "r") as file: # Change 'input.txt' to your actual input file path.
        inputs = read_input(file)
    write_output(inputs)
```

This Python solution includes three functions:
- `max_zero_and_value(n)` calculates the maximum value of integer k based on the given condition.
- `read_input(file)` reads the input from a specified file, parsing the number of test cases and the corresponding integers into a list of tuples.
- `write_output(output)` writes the calculated results back to standard output, aligning with the original requirements.

It also introduces file handling by reading input from a file named "input.txt". Adjust the filename as needed for different use cases.
