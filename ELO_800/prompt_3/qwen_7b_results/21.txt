```python
from typing import List

def min_pockets(coins: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Determine the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all coins so no two coins with the same value are in the same pocket.
    
    Args:
    coins (List[int]): A list of integers representing the values of the coins.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of pockets required.
    """
    unique_coins = set(coins)
    return len(unique_coins)

# Reading input from stdin
n = int(input())
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Printing the result to stdout
print(min_pockets(coins))
```

### Critique of the First Solution:

**Issue:** 
In the first solution, `min_pockets` counts each coin's occurrences and then returns the highest count. This approach works but is unnecessarily complex for the given problem. It involves extra steps (creating a dictionary and then counting keys) and isn't optimal when aiming for minimal code complexity.

**Optimization:**
The optimal solution uses a set instead. A set in Python automatically removes duplicates, so converting the list of coins into a set counts each distinct coin value exactly once. Since the problem asks for the minimum number of pockets needed, which corresponds directly to the number of unique coin values, using a set makes the logic much more straightforward.

### New Solution:

The new solution utilizes the properties of sets in Python effectively. By passing the list of coin values to a set (`unique_coins = set(coins)`), it immediately creates a collection of unique values without needing to iterate over them manually or create a dictionary. Then, it simply returns the length of this set, which directly represents the minimum number of pockets required.

This solution not only achieves the desired outcome more efficiently but also enhances readability and simplicity, adhering to the best practices of Python programming.
