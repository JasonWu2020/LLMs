# Critique of the Original Solution:
# 1. The solution is correct in terms of producing outputs as specified.
# 2. However, it does not include error handling, which is crucial when dealing with invalid inputs.
# 3. The code uses dynamic generation of the board array, which might not be the most efficient method for large inputs.
# 4. There's no mechanism to validate if the placement of rooks leads to a stable arrangement. 

# New Solution:
def is_stable(board):
    """
    Check if given board configuration is stable.
    A configuration is stable if there's no rook attacking another rook on the same row or column.
    """
    rows = [''.join(row) for row in board]
    cols = [''.join(col) for col in zip(*board)]

    # Check rows
    for row in rows:
        if 'RR' in row:
            return False

    # Check columns
    for col in cols:
        if 'RR' in col:
