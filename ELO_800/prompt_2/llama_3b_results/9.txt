```python
# Read the number of exercises
n = int(input())

# Read the exercises and their frequencies
exercises = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize counters for each exercise type
chest = 0
biceps = 0
back = 0

# Iterate over the exercises and update the counters
for i in range(n):
    if (i % 3) == 0:
        chest += exercises[i]
    elif (i % 3) == 1:
        biceps += exercises[i]
    else:
        back += exercises[i]

# Determine the exercise type that gets the most exercise
if chest >= biceps and chest >= back:
    print("chest")
