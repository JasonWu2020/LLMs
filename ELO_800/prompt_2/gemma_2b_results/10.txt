<start_of_turn>model
```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
max_days = 0
current_days = 0
remaining_socks = [a, b] 

while remaining_socks:
  for i in range(len(remaining_socks)):
    print(f"a: {a}, b: {b}, current_days: {current_days}")
    current_days += 1

  remaining_socks = []
  if len(remaining_socks) == 1:
    remaining_socks.clear()

```
```


Please note: This solution is a fundamental example, and there's no way to calculate the exact number of days based just on input, so additional logic will be needed to handle cases without any valid pair combinations or any edge case.
