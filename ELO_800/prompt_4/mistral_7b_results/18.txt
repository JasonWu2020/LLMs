[/INST] The outputted solution correctly reads the input and solves the problem using dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence between two arrays. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to the code to make it more concise and efficient.

First, instead of using a list to store the input arrays, you can use a tuple since the elements are already integers. This saves the memory overhead of storing the empty list for each test case. Also, instead of using a list to store the common subsequence, you can use an empty list `c` and append the elements directly to it, since you don't need to keep track of the subsequence in its original order.

Second, instead of using a nested list comprehension to initialize the matrix `dp`, you can use a single line to initialize it with zeros. Also, you can use `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j]` instead of the longer `if` statement to simplify the logic.

Third, instead of using `sys.exit()` to exit the program when no common subsequence is found, you can simply return from the function.

Here is the improved solution:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    n, m = len(a), len(b)
    dp = [[0] * (m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    c = []

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, m+1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if a[i-1] != b[j-1] else dp[i][j-1] + 1
            if dp[i][j] > len(c):
                c.clear()
                c.append(a[i-1])

    if dp[n][m] == 0:
        return
    print("YES")
    print(len(c))
    print(*c)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    longest_common_subsequence(a, b)
```

This solution has the same time complexity as the original solution, but it is more concise and follows the Python coding style more closely.</s>
