[/INST] The outputted solution is as follows:

```python
# The solution provided in the previous answer is correct and efficient, but it can be improved in terms of readability
# by using built-in functions instead of bitwise operations.

import sys
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    k = int(bin(int(f"{bin(n-1)[2:]}[1:0]")[::-1], 2)
    print(k)
```

The above solution uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to its binary representation as a string, and then uses slicing and indexing to extract the LSB and flip it to get the required value of $k$. The `int()` function is used to convert the binary string back to an integer for printing.

However, it should be noted that this solution is less efficient than the previous one as it involves string manipulation and conversion operations, which are generally slower than bitwise operations. The previous solution is preferred for performance-critical applications.</s>
