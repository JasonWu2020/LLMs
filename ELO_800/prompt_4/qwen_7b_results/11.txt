### Critique of the Solution

The provided Python script is succinct and functional for solving the given problem. However, there are a few potential improvements and optimizations to consider:

#### Potential Improvements:
1. **Code Readability**: Adding comments to explain what each part of the code does would enhance readability, especially for others who might review the code. This could be beneficial when working on larger projects or for sharing with others.
   
#### Revised Solution:
Here's a revised version of the solution with added comments and adherence to Python best practices:

```python
def min_shovels(k, r):
    """
    Determine the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy to pay without any change,
    given the shovel's price 'k' and the coin denomination 'r' in his pocket.
    
    Args:
    k (int): The price of one shovel in burles.
    r (int): The denomination of the coin Polycarp has, in burles.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy.
    """
    # Initialize the total number of shovels
    total_shovels = 1
    
    # Calculate the number of '10-burle coins' needed
    additional_coins_needed = (k - r) // 10
    
    # If there's a remainder, add another shovel to account for the 'r' burles coin
    if (k - r) % 10 != 0:
        total_shovels += 1
    
    return total_shovels

# Read input from stdin
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Print the solution to stdout
print(min_shovels(k, r))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Docstring**: I've added a docstring above the function `min_shovels` to describe its purpose, parameters, and return value. This helps other developers understand the function at a glance.
   
2. **Comments**: The comments within the code block explain each step clearly, enhancing readability. Comments are a crucial part of writing maintainable and understandable code.

3. **Function Descriptive Naming**: The function name `min_shovels` is clear and descriptive. It communicates the purpose of the function effectively.

4. **Input/Output Handling**: The `input()` function captures user input, and the result of the `min_shovels` function is printed to the console. This adheres to the given input and output specifications.

This revised solution retains the original functionality while improving upon aspects such as readability and maintainability.
