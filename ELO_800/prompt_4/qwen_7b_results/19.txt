```python
# The original code solves the problem correctly, but it lacks proper comments and the usage of python-specific features like generators and comprehensions which could improve readability and efficiency.

# The new solution will make use of these features to improve the code quality while maintaining the same logic and functionality.

# Start of code block

def find_max_k(n):
    # Utilize a generator expression to count the number of iterations until n becomes 0
    # This is more pythonic and efficient than using a while loop.
    return sum(1 for _ in range(n.bit_length()) if n & (1 << _) > 0)

# Main function to handle input and output as per the requirements
def main():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(find_max_k(n))

# Entry point of the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# End of code block
```
