This revised version includes a few enhancements to improve clarity and maintainability. 

### Improvements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function now accepts `List[str]` for the `hand_cards_strs`, allowing for flexibility in the number of inputs provided for the cards in the hand.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Changed `hand_cards` from a list to a set (`{(card[0], card[1]) for card in hand_cards_strs}`). This change improves efficiency when checking if a card exists in the set, as lookup times in sets are generally faster than lists.
   
3. **Error Handling**: The code now uses `sys.stdin.readlines()` instead of manual string slicing. This makes the function more robust to input variations and easier to extend with additional checks.

4. **Comments**: Added comments to clarify what the function does and what each part of the code is intended to achieve.

5. **Code Style**: Improved readability with consistent spacing around operators and proper indentation.

Remember, these suggestions aim to enhance the initial solution based on best practices and readability.
