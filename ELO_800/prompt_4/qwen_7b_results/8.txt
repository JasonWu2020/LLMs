### Critique of the Initial Solution

The initial Python script provided aims to calculate and output the maximum number of stones Alice can collect under the given rules. Here are the points of critique:

1. **Clarity and Comments:** There is no explicit explanation or comments within the code, making it difficult for others to understand the logic behind the computations quickly.

2. **Functionality:** The function `print(max_stones * 3)` works well for calculating the maximum number of stones she can collect by performing operations. However, the way `max_stones` is computed can be improved for clarity.

3. **Input/Output Handling:** The script reads the number of test cases (`_`) but then moves on without clearly mentioning its usage or how it's related to the main loop. Similarly, the way the inputs are processed for `a`, `b`, and `c` could be more intuitive.

4. **Code Structure:** The code could be structured more efficiently by using functions or variables with clearer names to enhance readability and maintainability.

### Revised Solution

Here's a revised version of the solution that addresses these critiques:

```python
# Function to compute the maximum number of stones Alice can collect
def max_stones_collected(stones_heap1, stones_heap2, stones_heap3):
    # The limiting factor would be the minimum of these two scenarios:
    # 1. The first operation's requirement (heap1 >= 1 and heap2 >= 2),
    # 2. The second operation's requirement (heap2 >= 1 and heap3 >= 2)
    # Considering efficiency and ensuring that we don't exceed available stones,
    # we choose the minimum between (a) the total stones in heaps 2 and 3 divided by 2, and (b) the total available stones.
    return min(stones_heap1, min(stones_heap2 // 2 + stones_heap3 // 2, stones_heap2 + stones_heap3))

# Reading the number of test cases
num_cases = int(input())

# Loop through each test case
for _ in range(num_cases):
    # Reading the number of stones in each heap
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculating and printing the maximum number of stones Alice can collect
    print(max_stones_collected(a, b, c) * 3)

```

This version enhances clarity by:

- Adding comments and explanations for better understanding.
- Separating the core logic into a distinct function `max_stones_collected` for better reusability and separation of concerns.
- Explicitly handling the reading of test cases and the subsequent calculations and outputs in a clear and modular way.
