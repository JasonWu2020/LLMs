```python
# Python 3.8 code block starts here

for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the remainder of a divided by b.
    # If the remainder is zero, it means 'a' is divisible by 'b', hence 0 moves are needed.
    # Otherwise, the number of moves is equal to the remainder.
    moves_needed = 0 if a % b == 0 else a % b
    print(moves_needed)

# Python 3.8 code block ends here
```
This solution takes into account the critical feedback points regarding the original solution:

- **Explanation**: Provided comments explain the functionality of the program, making it easier for others to understand the logic being implemented.
- **Code Blocks**: Used the Python tag and ``` to delineate the start and end of the code blocks for clear separation of concerns and easy readability.

The critique aimed to ensure the new solution was self-contained, properly formatted, and included necessary comments for clarity.
