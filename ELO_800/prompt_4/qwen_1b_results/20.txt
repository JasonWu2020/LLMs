### Solution 1 (Original Code)

```python
def max_k(n):
    k = 0
    while True:
        if n & k == 0:
            return k
        k += 1

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(max_k(n))
```

### Critique of Solution 1
- **Time Complexity**: The original solution has a time complexity of O(log n), where `n` is the given number. However, it can be improved by using bitwise operations more efficiently.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a few extra variables (`k`, `n`) regardless of the size of `n`.

### Improved Solution

```python
def max_k_optimized(n):
    i = 0
    mask = n - 1
    while mask != 0:
        mask >>= 1
        i += 1
    return i

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(max_k_optimized(n))
```

### Critique of Improved Solution
- **Time Complexity**: The optimized solution now has a time complexity of O(1), which means it runs in constant time regardless of the size of `n`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity remains O(1) because we still use a fixed amount of memory to store the current bit position (`i`).
