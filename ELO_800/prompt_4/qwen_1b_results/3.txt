I understand. Let's tackle the problem step-by-step:

### Problem Breakdown:
We need to determine whether we can place `k` rooks on an `n x n` chessboard such that they form a "stable" arrangement. A stable arrangement means that no rook can be moved to an adjacent cell without breaking the condition that no two rooks share the same row or column.

### Approach:
1. **Check Feasibility**: First, we need to check if placing `k` rooks on an `n x n` board is even possible given constraints (`1 <= k <= n <= 40`). If `k > n`, return `-1`.
2. **Placement Strategy**: We can use backtracking to try different placements of rooks and verify stability.

### Python Code Implementation:
```python
def is_stable(board):
    def check(stab_board, i, j):
        # Check rows
        for r in range(n):
            if stab_board[r][j] == 'R':
                return False
        # Check columns
        for c in range(n):
            if stab_board[i][c] == 'R':
                return False
        return True
    
    n = len(board)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if board[i][j] == '.':
                stab_board = [row[:] for row in board]
                stab_board[i][j] = 'R'
                if check(stab_board, i, j):
                    return True
    return False

def place_rooks(k, n):
    def backtrack(i):
        nonlocal result
        if i == k:
            if is_stable(result):
                print(''.join(row + ['\n'] for row in result))
                result = []
            return
        for j in range(n):
            if (result and result[-1][j] != '.') and ((i == 0 and j == 0) or (result[0][0] - abs(j - result[0][0]) == i)):
                continue
            result.append((i, j))
            backtrack(i + 1)
            result.pop()
    
    result = []
    backtrack(0)

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k > n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        place_rooks(k, n)
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_stable Function**: Checks if placing rooks at position `(i, j)` forms a stable arrangement.
2. **place_rooks Function**: Uses backtracking to try placing rooks on the board. It keeps track of the current placement using a list of tuples representing positions of rooks.
3. **Backtrack Function**: Recursively tries to place rooks until `k` rooks are placed or it finds a stable configuration.

### Output Example:
For the provided example:
- For `t = 1`, `n = 3`, `k = 2`: Place rooks at positions `(1, 1)` and `(1, 3)`. The output would look like:
  ```
  R...
....
.R..
```
  
- For `t = 2`, `n = 3`, `k = 3`: No valid stable arrangement exists since placing 3 rooks on a 3x3 board is impossible due to constraint `k <= n`.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify either a stable arrangement or indicate that none exist within the given constraints.
