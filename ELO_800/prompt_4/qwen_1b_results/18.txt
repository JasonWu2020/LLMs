```

This Python script reads the input data for each test case, processes it using the `findSubsequence` function, and prints out the appropriate results. The `findSubsequence` function checks all possible subsequences of the first array (`a`) that are also subsequences of the second array (`b`). It keeps track of the minimum length of such subsequences and returns them accordingly.
