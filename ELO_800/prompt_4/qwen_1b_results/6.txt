Solution:

```python
def can_play_card(table_card, player_cards):
    # Convert the table card into its numerical value
    table_card_num = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}[table_card[0]]
    
    # Check if any of the player cards match the table card's number or suit
    for card in player_cards:
        card_num = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}[card[0]]
        
        if card[0] == table_card[0] or card_num == table_card_num:
            return True
    
    return False


# Read input
table_card = input().strip()
player_cards = [input().strip() for _ in range(5)]

# Print output
print('YES' if can_play_card(table_card, player_cards) else 'NO')
```

This Python script reads the input specification provided earlier, checks whether it is possible to play a card from the player's hand given the card on the table, and prints out the result accordingly. 

Please note that the logic inside the `can_play_card` function may not work correctly if the input data does not adhere to the constraints mentioned in the original problem statement. If the input data format differs significantly, additional validation steps should be implemented before performing the actual comparison between the card numbers and suits.
