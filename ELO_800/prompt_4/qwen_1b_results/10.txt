### Critique of the Outputted Solution:

The provided Python script reads the inputs `a` and `b`, representing the number of red and blue socks respectively. It calculates the maximum number of days Vasya can wear different socks and the remaining days after running out of unique pairs. The script outputs these values correctly based on the given constraints. However, there are some improvements that could enhance its readability and efficiency:

1. **Simplicity**: The script uses straightforward arithmetic operations and conditional statements to calculate the results.
2. **Efficiency**: No unnecessary computations are performed beyond the necessary calculations.
3. **Clarity**: Comments and variable names are clear, making it easier to understand the logic.

### Improved Python Code:

```python
# Read the number of red and blue socks
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the maximum number of days with different socks
max_days_diff = min(a, b)

# Calculate the remaining days after running out of unique pairs
remaining_days = max(0, a + b - 2 * max_days_diff)

# Print the results
print(max_days_diff, remaining_days)
```

This improved version simplifies the main logic while keeping the structure clean and easy to follow. It avoids unnecessary complexity and focuses solely on solving the problem efficiently.
