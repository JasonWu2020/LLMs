max_stones()
```

This solution works by iterating through each test case and comparing the number of stones in the first and second heaps to the number of stones in the third heap. It then determines the maximum number of stones that can be taken and prints the result. This approach ensures that Alice takes the maximum number of stones possible while satisfying the conditions of the problem.
