```python

    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0]):
            print(board[i][j], end=' ')

        if solve(n, k-1, i+1, col, board, result):

            return True
        board[i][col] = -1
    return False

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    board = [[-1]*n for _ in range(n)]
    result = []

**Critique:**

- The solution is too simplistic and doesn't consider all possible cases, such as when k is 3 and n is 4.
- It doesn't handle the case where the solution is not possible.
- The code doesn't handle the case where k is 1 and n is 1.

**Solution:**

```python
def print_board(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            print(board[i][j], end=' ')
        print()

def solve(n, k, row, col, board, result):
    if k == 0:
        return result
    if row == n:
        return True
    for c in range(col, n):
        board[row][c] = -1
        if solve(n, k, row+1, c, board, result):
            result.append(str(row+1))
            return True
        board[row][c] = -1
    return False

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    board = [[-1]*n for _ in range(n)]
    if k == 1:
        print_board([[1]])
    elif k == 2:
        print_board([[1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 1]])
    else:
        result = []
        if solve(n, k, 0, 0, board, result):
            print_board(result)
        else:
            print(-1)

main()
```
