<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**
The solution is well-written and efficient. It finds the common multiple of the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket in a single iteration over the factors of the price of one shovel. The time complexity of the code is O(sqrt(k)). 

**Improved Solution:**

```python3.8
k, r = map(int, input().split())
g = egregence(k, r)
print(g)
```

```python3.8
def egregence(a, b):
    for i in range(1, int(a**0.5) + 1):
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            return i

    return -1
```<eos>
