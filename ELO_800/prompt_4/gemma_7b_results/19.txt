**Critique:**

The solution above is correct, but it can be simplified. The loop can be iterated from 0 to the square root of $n$ instead of iterating over the entire range from 1 to $n$. This is because the maximum value of $k$ will be the square root of $n$.

**Improved solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = int((n ** 0.5).floor())
    print(k)
```<eos>
