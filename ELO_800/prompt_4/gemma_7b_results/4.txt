**Critique:**

The solution is straightforward and efficient. It iterates over the encrypted string only once, and the time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string. However, the solution could be improved by using a dictionary to store the characters that have already been added after each character in $a. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n) as well.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()

    a = ""
    added_chars = {}
    for i in s:
        if i not in added_chars:
            added_chars[i] = 0
        added_chars[i] += 1
    for i in s:
        char_added = s[s.index(i) + 1: s.index(i) + 1]
        a += s.replace(char_added, "")

    print(a)
```<eos>
