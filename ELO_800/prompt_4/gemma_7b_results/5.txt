**Critique:**

The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case reads two integers, $a$ and $b$. It calculates the greatest multiple of $b that is less than or equal to $a$ using integer division and then calculates the minimum number of moves required, which is $a - (b * multiple)$. The code is concise and efficient.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    multiple = a // b
    moves = a - multiple * b

    # Optimized for cases where a is divisible by b
    if a % b == 0:
        moves = 0
    print(moves)
```

**Explanation:**

In this improved solution, we check if $a$ is divisible by $b$ and if it is, we set the number of moves to 0. This optimization is important because it can significantly reduce the time complexity of the code.<eos>
