**Critique of the outputted solution**

The solution is mostly correct, but it has a few issues:

1. The solution does not handle the case where one of the input values is 0. In this case, the solution will print a negative number for the days where Vasya can wear the same socks.
2. The solution uses the `//` operator for integer division, which is not necessary in Python 3. The `//` operator is used for floor division, but in this case, we are dealing with small integers, and the `/` operator will also give us the correct result.
3. The solution uses the `max` function to handle the case where one of the input values is greater than the other. However, this is not necessary, as we can simply subtract the smaller value from the larger value to get the remaining socks.

**Alternative solution**

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
days_different = min(a, b)
remaining_a = abs(a - b)
remaining_b = remaining_a
same_days = min(remaining_a // 2, min(a, b) // 2)
if remaining_a % 2 == 1:
    same_days += 1
print(days_different, same_days)
```

This solution is more concise and handles the edge case where one of the input values is 0. It also uses the `abs` function to calculate the remaining socks, and the `min` function to find the minimum of two values.
