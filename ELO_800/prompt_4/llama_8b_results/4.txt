The outputted solution is quite concise and effective. However, it uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of the current character in the string, which has a time complexity of O(n) for each character in the string. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2) for the entire solution.

A more efficient solution would be to use a stack to keep track of the characters in the string, which allows us to find the next occurrence of a character in constant time.

```python
import sys

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    stack = []
    for c in s:
        if stack and stack[-1] == c:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(c)
    print(''.join(stack))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), making it more efficient for large inputs. It also uses a more Pythonic approach, utilizing the built-in join function to concatenate the characters in the stack into a single string.
