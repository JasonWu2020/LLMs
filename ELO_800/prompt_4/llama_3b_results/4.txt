**Critique of the Outputted Solution:**

The outputted solution is concise and readable. However, it can be improved for better performance and readability. The solution uses a while loop to iterate over the input string `s`, and it modifies the string `s` in place. This can lead to issues if the input string is modified during the iteration, as it can cause the loop to skip or process incorrect characters.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    i = 0
    result = ""
    while i < n:
        if not result or result[-1] == s[i]:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            i += 2
    print(result)
```

In this improved solution, we use a separate variable `i` to keep track of the current index in the input string `s`. We increment `i` by 1 when we add a character to the result and by 2 when we skip a character. This way, we avoid modifying the input string `s` during the iteration, ensuring that the loop processes all characters correctly.
