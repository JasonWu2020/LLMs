Critique of the outputted solution:

The outputted solution is concise and efficient. It directly calculates the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy by finding the smallest multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `r`. However, it does not handle the case where `r` is greater than `k`.

To improve the solution, we can add a simple check to handle this case.

Here's the critique:

* The solution is easy to understand and implement.
* It is concise and efficient.
* It handles the case where `r` is less than `k` correctly.

However, it does not handle the case where `r` is greater than `k`.

Here's the improved solution:

```python
k, r = map(int, input().split())

ans = k
while (ans // k) * r < r:
    ans += k

print(ans)
```

This solution adds an additional check to ensure that `ans` is greater than or equal to `r` before printing the result. This handles the case where `r` is greater than `k`.
