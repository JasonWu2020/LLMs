You're right! The previous code is missing a critical feature; it didn't account for how to determine how many times the first 'k' letters occur in the strings. 

Here's an improved solution that addresses that: 

```python
def longest_good_subsequence(n, k , s):
    dp = [0] * (k+1) # dynamic programming table to store the count, indexed by letter
    for i in range(len(s)):
      if s[i] == 'A':
        dp[s.index('A')] = 1  
    
    for i in range(1, len(s)): # Loop through possible start positions of subsequence(s)
        for j in range(i, min(len(s), i+1)): # loop through all valid positions that we are looking at
          try: 	    		
              current_char = s[j]
			  if dp[current_char]:
		        dp[current_char] += 1
          except IndexError:			    
            pass
    return max(dp)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    print(longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s))
``` 




Let me know If you have further questions or would like more clarification.<end_of_turn>
