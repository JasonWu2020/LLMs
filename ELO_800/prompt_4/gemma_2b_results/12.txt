The provided solution is functional, but could be made more efficient and refined. 


```python
def balancedSubstring(s):
  """
  Determines if the given string 's' contains at least one balanced substring.

  Args:
      s (string): String to check
  Returns:
      int: [start, end] of the balanced substring if found, otherwise -1 -1
  """ 
  n = len(s)
  if n == 0:
    return [-1, -1] 
  balance = 0
  for i in range(n):
   if s[i] == 'a':
     balance +=1
   if s[i] == 'b':
     balance -=1
     if balance<0:
      return [-1, -1]
  if balance == 0:
    return [0, n] 
  return [-1, -1] 

def main():
  T = int(input())
  for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = balancedSubstring(s)
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
**Explanation of the Code** 

* **Input Handling:**  The `input()` function reads the inputs from the shell. Input must be converted accordingly
* **Solution:** An efficient method of finding balanced sub-strings.
