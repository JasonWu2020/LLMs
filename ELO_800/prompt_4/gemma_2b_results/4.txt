The provided solution effectively solves the problem by iterating through the input string $s$, it's a bit difficult to understand and might not be the most efficient approach. A more optimized and clearer solution is possible

```python
def decrypt(s):
    n = len(s)
    a = ''
    for i in range(n): 
        if i == 0:
            j = 0
        else:
            if s[i] != s[i-1]:
                j = 0
            else :
                j = i 
        if s[i] == 'a':
            a += s[i]
        else:
            for x in range(j+1):
                a += s[i]
    return a 



t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(decrypt(s))      
```
