<start_of_turn>model
The provided solution is well-formatted and follows the provided constraints.  It effectively reads in the number of test cases *and* then calculates and prints the solution for each one.

Here are some potential improvements for cleaner code or added clarity:

```python
# ... (previous code)

def solve(a, b):
    return abs(a % b)

# get the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# read the integers 
for i in range(t):
  a = int(input())
  b = int(input())
  print(solve(a, b)) 
```

**Explanation and Key Points:**

* `for` Loop Structure:  Using the `for` loop structure is good and understandable.
*  `abs` Function:  Using `abs()`.
