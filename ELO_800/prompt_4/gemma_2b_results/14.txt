The provided solution is a bit simplistic, and it might not be the most optimized one. If your goal is to print the solution to the server as a result, ensure it's valid and complete. 

```python
def solve(n, k, a):
    d = max(a)
    modified_array = [d - x for x in a]
    return modified_array   
T = int(input())
for t in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = solve(n, k, a)
    print(*res)
```
  



Here's why it's a better approach, according to the specifications and best practices for solutions on a platform like this

* **Efficient Input Handling:** It clearly asks for input values
* **Read input & Perform Calculation:** The solution will take the provided values, calculate, and return a result for each example.
* **Print Input:** Prints the array as a string, formatted for readability within the specifications for the server.
