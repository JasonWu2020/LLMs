```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    for i in range(n-1):
        diff = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            if s[j] == 'a':
                diff += 1
            else:
                diff -= 1
            if diff == 0:
                print(i+1, j+1)
                break
    else:
        print(-1, -1)
