```python
def solve(n, a, b):
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
      if a >= len(str(i)) and b >= len(str(i)):
        if a == len(str(i)) and b == len(str(i)):
          print("Yes")
      
# This is the function that you will use to solve the problem.

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, a, b) 
```



**Explanation:** 
 
This Code Reads the  number of test cases (`t`), then it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user input in each test case and then uses the `solve` function to  solve it.
