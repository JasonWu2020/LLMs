```python
def is_stable(board, size):
  n = size
  matrix = [ [0 for x in range(n)] for x in range(n)]
  for i in range(0, n):
      for j in range(0, n):
          if board[i][j] == 1:
              matrix[i][j] = 1

  # ...code goes here...


def solve_problem(n, k):
    # ...code goes here...

if __name__ == "__main__":  
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
  
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        solve_problem(n, k) 
``` 



Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on this code. <end_of_turn>
