### Critique of the provided solution:

The provided solution appears to implement an algorithm for determining whether Anton has performed well enough in a given contest based on his ratings and the colors of other users' handles. However, there are several issues and improvements that can be made to ensure correctness and efficiency.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ratings**: The current logic does not correctly determine if a user's rating has increased after the contest.
2. **Handling of User Handles**: The logic assumes that a user's handle changes their color based solely on their rating, which may not always be accurate due to potential system-level factors affecting handle colorings.
3. **Complexity**: The current implementation seems overly complex and could benefit from simplification.

### Improved Solution:

```python
def check_contest_performance(n, contests):
    # Initialize dictionary to keep track of previous ratings
    prev_ratings = {}
    
    # Iterate through each contest result
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        name, before_rating, after_rating = contests[i]
        
        # Check if the user's handle is already colored red
        if name in prev_ratings:
            continue
        
        # Update the previous ratings dictionary
        prev_ratings[name] = before_rating
        
        # Determine if the performance is good
        if after_rating > before_rating:
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

# Read input
n = int(input())
contests = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]

# Output the result
print(check_contest_performance(n, contests))
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Dictionary for Previous Ratings**: A `prev_ratings` dictionary is used to store the rating of each user before the contest.
2. **Efficient Rating Checking**: Instead of checking if a user's handle is colored red every time, we only update the dictionary when necessary. This reduces redundancy.
3. **Simplified Logic**: The logic now checks if the user's handle exists in the `prev_ratings` dictionary and skips performing the comparison if so. This ensures that we only compare new contestants.
4. **Return Early**: If a contestant's rating increases after the contest, we immediately return "YES" without further processing.

This revised approach should improve efficiency and accuracy while maintaining the required functionality.
