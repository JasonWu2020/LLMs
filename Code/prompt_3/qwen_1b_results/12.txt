Solution Critique:
The provided Python script correctly identifies all instances where a balanced substring exists within the input string `s`. However, it does so by checking every possible substring individually, which can be inefficient for larger inputs (e.g., with `n` up to 50).

Given that the task requires identifying *any* balanced substring rather than checking all possible ones, an optimized approach would be more suitable. 

Here's a revised solution using dynamic programming to efficiently find any balanced substring:

```python
def find_balanced_substring(s):
    dp = [False] * len(s)
    
    # Initialize DP array with False values
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'a':
            dp[i] = True
    
    # Check all prefixes and suffixes
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if dp[0]:
            return 1, i  # Found a balanced prefix
        elif dp[-i - 1]:
            return -i - 1, -i  # Found a balanced suffix
        
        j = i // 2 + i % 2
        while j < len(s):
            if dp[j]:
                break
            if s[j] == 'a':
                dp[j] = True
            j += 1
            
    return -1, -1  # No balanced substring found


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    
    num_testcases = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(num_testcases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        s = input().strip()
        
        result = find_balanced_substring(s)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)
```

Explanation of Changes:
1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We initialize a boolean array `dp` to track whether a character at position `i` forms a balanced substring when combined with the previous characters.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Checks**: We iterate through the string and check both prefixes (`j`) and suffixes (`i`) starting from half the length of the string towards the beginning.
3. **Early Return**: Once we find a balanced prefix or suffix, we immediately return the indices.
4. **No Balanced Substring**: If no balanced substring is found after full iteration, we return `-1 -1`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently identify any balanced substring, optimizing over the brute-force method used in the initial solution.
