**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient, but it could be improved.

**Critique:**

- The code reads the input, but it does not store the value of $n$.
- The code calculates the sum of digits of a number using the `str` and `split` methods, which is not the most efficient way to do this.
- The code finds the answer by subtracting 1 from the sum of digits of $n$, which is correct, but it could be optimized.

**Revised Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(int(i) for i in str(n).split())
    print(s - 1)
```

**Revised Explanation:**

- The code reads the input and stores the value of $n$.
- The code calculates the sum of digits of $n using a list comprehension and the `int` function to convert strings to integers.
- The code uses the sum of digits to find the answer and prints the result.<eos>
