**Critique:**

The solution is straightforward. The key is to find the integer division of (r - 1) by k and add 1 to the result. This is because Polycarp needs to buy at least one shovel, and the number of shovels he can buy is equal to the integer division of (r - 1) by k.

**Solution:**

```python
k, r = map(int, input().split())

print(int((r - 1) // k + 1))
```

**Generated Solution:**

```python
k, r = map(int, input().split())

n = (r - 1) // k
s = n + 1

print(s)
```<eos>
