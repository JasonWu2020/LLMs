<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient but lacks clarity. It uses the minimum of *a* and *b* twice, which is redundant. The second term should be *min(a, b) - 1* instead of *min(a, b) + min(a, b) - 1*.

**Revised Solution:**

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(min(a, b) + min(a, b) - 1, min(a, b) - 1)
```<eos>
