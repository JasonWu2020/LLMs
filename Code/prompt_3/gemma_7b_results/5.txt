**Critique:**

The solution above reads the input, calculates the quotient of $a$ divided by $b$, and prints the result. However, it does not handle the case where $a$ is already divisible by $b$. In this case, the output should be 0.

**Improved Solution:**

```python3.8
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    moves = a // b
    if a % b == 0:
        moves = 0
    print(moves)
```

This solution fixes the issue by checking if $a$ is divisible by $b$ and if it is, it assigns 0 moves.<eos>
