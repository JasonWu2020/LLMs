**Critique of the outputted solution**

The solution provided is concise and directly addresses the problem. However, it may not be the most efficient or clear solution for someone who is not familiar with the problem. The use of `min` function with multiple arguments can be a bit confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with the `min` function's behavior.

The solution also assumes that the input will not contain any invalid values (e.g., negative numbers or non-integer values). While the problem statement specifies that the inputs will be non-negative integers, it's always a good practice to include some error checking code to handle potential edge cases.

**Alternative solution**

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        ans = 0
        while a >= 1 and b >= 2:
            ans += 1
            a -= 1
            b -= 2
        while b >= 1 and c >= 2:
            ans += 1
            b -= 1
            c -= 2
        print(ans)
```

This solution is a bit more verbose, but it explicitly calculates the maximum number of stones Alice can take by simulating the operations. It also includes a check for the case where all three heaps are empty, in which case the answer is 0.
