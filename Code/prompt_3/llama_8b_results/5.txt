The outputted solution is concise and efficient. However, it could benefit from some additional comments to explain the logic behind the solution. Here's a revised version:

```python
# Read the number of test cases
n = int(input())

# Loop through each test case
for _ in range(n):
    # Read the values of a and b
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make a divisible by b
    # The expression (a // b + (a % b!= 0)) - 1 works as follows:
    # a // b gives the quotient of a divided by b, which is the number of times b fits into a
    # a % b!= 0 is a boolean value that is True if a is not divisible by b, and False otherwise
    # In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0, so adding (a % b!= 0) adds 1 to the quotient if a is not divisible by b
    # Subtracting 1 gives the minimum number of moves needed to make a divisible by b
    print((a // b + (a % b!= 0)) - 1)
```

Here's an alternative solution that uses the ceil function from the math module to calculate the minimum number of moves needed:

```python
import math

# Read the number of test cases
n = int(input())

# Loop through each test case
for _ in range(n):
    # Read the values of a and b
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make a divisible by b
    # The ceil function returns the smallest integer not less than the given number
    # In this case, we use it to calculate the smallest integer greater than or equal to a/b
    # Subtracting a/b from this result gives the minimum number of moves needed to make a divisible by b
    print(math.ceil(a / b) - a // b)
```
