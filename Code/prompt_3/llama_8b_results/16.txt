The outputted solution is correct in terms of logic, but it can be improved for better readability and maintainability. 

Here's a critique of the solution:

1. The variable name `t` could be more descriptive. `num_test_cases` would be a better name.
2. The variable name `n` could also be more descriptive. `upper_limit` would be a better name.
3. The variable name `_` is not descriptive and does not follow PEP 8 conventions. It's better to use a descriptive name like `test_case`.
4. The comment is missing.

Here's another solution that adheres to the same input and output specifications:

```python
# Read the number of test cases
num_test_cases = int(input())

# Process each test case
for test_case in range(num_test_cases):
    # Read the upper limit
    upper_limit = int(input())

    # Calculate the number of interesting numbers
    if upper_limit < 10:
        result = 0
    else:
        result = upper_limit - 10 + (upper_limit // 10 >= 2)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
```

This solution is more readable and maintainable, and it follows PEP 8 conventions.
