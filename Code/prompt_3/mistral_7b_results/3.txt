[/INST] The outputted solution correctly reads the input, checks for validity of the input, and generates the output according to the problem statement. However, it could be improved in terms of readability and efficiency.

Here is a more efficient and readable solution:

```python
def is_attacking(board, r1, c1, r2, c2):
    return r1 == r2 or c1 == c2 or abs(r1-r2) == abs(c1-c2)

def is_valid(board, pos, n):
    rooks = set()
    for r, c in pos:
        rooks.add((r, c))
        for r2, c2 in pos:
            if (r, c2) in rooks or (r2, c) in rooks:
                return False
    return True if len(pos) == k else False

def backtrack(n, pos, pos_set, index):
    if index == len(pos):
        return is_valid(pos, pos_set, n)

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        pos_new = list(pos)
        pos_new[index] = (i,)
        pos_set_new = pos_set.union({(i, j) for j in range(1, n+1)})
        if is_valid(pos_new, pos_set_new, n):
            pos[index] = pos_new[index]
            yield pos_new
            pos_set_new.difference_update(pos_set)

def solve(n, k):
    if k > n:
        print(-1)
        return
    pos = [(0, 0)]*k
    for solution in backtrack(n, pos, set(), 0):
        print('.'*(n*n-k) + 'R'*k)
        for r, c in solution:
            print(f'{r*n+c:0{n}d}R' if r*n+c == r*n or r*n+c == c else 'R.'[(r, c) in solution])

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

This solution uses a set to store the positions of the rooks currently being considered, and checks for attacks only against those positions. This makes the backtracking function much more efficient as it doesn't need to check the entire board each time. Additionally, it uses a generator expression to yield all valid solutions, and prints them one by one instead of storing them in memory.</s>
