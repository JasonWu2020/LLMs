Sure, I'll critique the provided solution and then generate a new solution adhering to the same input and output specifications.

### Critique
Without seeing the actual solution, I'll assume a common approach that involves finding the smallest multiple of `k` that is divisible by `10` and subtracts the value of `r`. This approach works well but might not always be optimal.

Here's a simple brute-force solution that checks each possible number of shovels starting from 1 until it finds a valid payment method:

```python
def find_min_shovels(k, r):
    # Start checking from 1 shovel
    for shovels in range(1, 1001):  # Arbitrary upper limit, can be adjusted
        total = shovels * k
        if total % 10 == r:
            return shovels
    return -1  # Shouldn't reach here if the problem constraints are correct

# Read input
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Find and print the result
print(find_min_shovels(k, r))
```

### New Solution
This solution iterates through the number of shovels starting from 1 and checks if the total cost after removing the `r`-burle coin is divisible by 10. If it is, the function returns the number of shovels. If no such number is found within a reasonable range, it would indicate an error in the problem constraints.

However, this solution isn't optimal. We can improve it by focusing on the remainder when `k` is divided by 10 and adjusting accordingly. Let's implement this more efficient approach:

```python
def find_min_shovels_optimized(k, r):
    # Calculate the remainder when k is divided by 10
    remainder = k % 10
    # Adjust k based on the remainder
    if remainder == r:
        k -= r
    elif remainder > r:
        k -= (remainder - r)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of shovels needed
    min_shovels = k // 10
    if k % 10 == r:
        min_shovels += 1
    
    return min_shovels

# Read input
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Find and print the result
print(find_min_shovels_optimized(k, r))
```

### Explanation
- **Optimization**: The key optimization here is adjusting `k` based on the remainder when `k` is divided by 10. This way, we can directly determine how many full sets of 10 burles can be formed and account for the remaining burles and the special coin.
- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures we find the minimum number of shovels efficiently without unnecessary iterations.

This should meet the requirements and run efficiently.
