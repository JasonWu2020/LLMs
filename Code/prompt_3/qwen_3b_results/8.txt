Sure, let's first critique the provided solution and then generate a new solution adhering to the same input and output specifications.

### Critique of Provided Solution
Since the provided solution is not available, I'll assume a typical approach for solving this problem based on the given constraints and requirements.

### Proposed Solution
Here's a Python script that reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and outputs the maximum number of stones Alice can take.

```python
def max_stones(t):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        max_stones = 0
        
        # First operation: take one stone from the first heap and two stones from the second heap
        max_stones += min(a, b // 2)
        
        # Second operation: take one stone from the second heap and two stones from the third heap
        max_stones += min(b - 2 * max_stones, c // 2)
        
        results.append(max_stones)
    
    return "\n".join(map(str, results))

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Process each test case and print the result
print(max_stones(t))
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Test Cases**: We first read the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, we read the number of stones in the three heaps (`a`, `b`, `c`).
   - We initialize `max_stones` to keep track of the maximum number of stones Alice can take.
   - We calculate the maximum number of stones using the two allowed operations:
     - From the first operation: `min(a, b // 2)` because Alice can take at most `b // 2` times, where `b >= 2`.
     - From the second operation: `min(b - 2 * max_stones, c // 2)` because Alice can take at most `c // 2` times, but considering the constraint that she already took `2 * max_stones` stones from the second heap.
3. **Output Results**: Finally, we print the results for all test cases.

This script ensures that the constraints and the logic for determining the maximum number of stones are correctly handled.
