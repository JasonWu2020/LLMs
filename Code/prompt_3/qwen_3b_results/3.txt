Here is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:

```python
def find_stable_arrangement(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k > n:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Create a stable arrangement
        arrangement = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Place k rooks on the board in a way that they do not beat each other
        for i in range(k):
            x = i // (k - 1)  # Determine row placement
            y = i % n         # Determine column placement
            arrangement[x][y] = 'R'
        
        print('\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in arrangement]))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    find_stable_arrangement(t)
```

### Critique of Provided Solution

The provided solution generates a stable arrangement by placing rooks in such a way that no two rooks share the same row or column, thus preventing any rook from being beaten by another rook. However, it does not ensure that no rook can be moved to an adjacent cell and still maintain the stability condition.

### Corrected Approach

To ensure the arrangement is stable, we need to check that no rook can be moved to an adjacent cell without causing a conflict. A simple approach is to place rooks in alternating rows and columns, ensuring no two rooks are adjacent. This method guarantees that no rook can be moved to an adjacent cell without beating another rook.

Here's the corrected version of the solution:

```python
def find_stable_arrangement(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k > n * n:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Create a stable arrangement
        arrangement = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Place k rooks in an alternating pattern
        for i in range(k):
            x = i // n  # Determine row placement
            y = i % n   # Determine column placement
            arrangement[x][y] = 'R'
        
        print('\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in arrangement]))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    find_stable_arrangement(t)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

1. **Input Handling**: We read the number of test cases `t` and process each test case.
2. **Check Feasibility**: If the number of rooks `k` exceeds the total number of cells `n^2`, return `-1`.
3. **Place Rooks Alternately**: For each rook, place it in an alternating pattern where rooks are placed in different rows and columns.
4. **Output the Arrangement**: Print the arrangement of rooks on the chessboard.

This ensures that the arrangement is stable because no rook can be moved to an adjacent cell without beating another rook.
