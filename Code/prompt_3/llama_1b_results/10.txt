Explanation:

- The function `fashion_days(a, b)` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, which represent the number of red and blue socks Vasya has.
- The function initializes several variables `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g` to keep track of the number of days when Vasya can wear different socks, the number of days when he can wear the same socks, and the number of days when he can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got.
- The function iterates over the range of days from 0 to `a + b` using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, it checks if Vasya has both red and blue socks left. If he does, it decrements the number of red and blue socks and decrements the number of days `c`. If the number of red socks is 0, it breaks the loop and moves to the next day.
- If Vasya has both red and blue socks left, it decrements the number of days `c` and prints the number of days `d` and `f`.
- If Vasya has only blue socks left, it decrements the number of days `c` and prints the number of days `f`.
- If Vasya has only red socks left, it decrements the number of days `g` and prints the number of days `g`.
- If Vasya has neither red nor blue socks left, it breaks the loop and moves to the next day.
