# Critique:

The initial solution provided meets all necessary conditions for input/output as specified. However, there might be room for optimization and readability improvements. The use of functions is not strictly necessary but adds an extra layer of abstraction. We can streamline this further by directly calculating and printing the result inside the main block of code. 

The critique version would look something like this:

```python
def calculate_days(red_socks: int, blue_socks: int) -> tuple:
    """Calculates the days Vasya can wear fashionable socks and then the days with same color socks."""
    # Calculate days with different colored socks
    different_colored_days = min(red_socks, blue_socks)
    
    # Calculate remaining days with same colored socks, if any
    same_colored_days = (max(red_socks, blue_socks) - different_colored_days) // 2
    
    return different_colored_days, same_colored_days

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read input
    red_socks, blue_socks = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate and print the result
    different_colored_days, same_colored_days = calculate_days(red_socks, blue_socks)
    print(different_colored_days, same_colored_days)
```

# Alternative Solution:

Here's an alternative solution, also adhering to the Python language and the input-output format. This solution takes advantage of Python's built-in functionality and one-liner style to calculate the answer succinctly.

```python
from typing import Tuple

def solve(input_string: str) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Solves the problem based on the input string and returns a tuple representing 
    the number of days Vasya can wear different socks and then the days he can wear the same socks.
    """
    # Split the input into list, then convert it to integers and return as a tuple
    red_socks, blue_socks = map(int, input_string.split())
    return min(red_socks, blue_socks), (max(red_socks, blue_socks) - min(red_socks, blue_socks)) // 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_solution = input()
    result = solve(input_solution)
    print(result[0], result[1])
```
