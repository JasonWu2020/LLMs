```python
# Function to check if a player can play a card from their hand in the Mau-Mau game
def can_play_card(table_card, hand_cards):
    # Check for same rank
    for card in hand_cards:
        if card[0] == table_card[0]:
            return 'YES'
    # Check for same suit
    for card in hand_cards:
        if card[1] == table_card[1]:
            return 'YES'
    # If no match found
    return 'NO'

# Main block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Reading the table card
    table_card = input().strip()
    # Reading hand cards
    hand_cards = [input().strip() for _ in range(5)]
    # Print result
    print(can_play_card(table_card, hand_cards))
```

The critique for the first solution:

- **Clarity**: The code was clear but used a loop to iterate over all hand cards for each condition (same rank and same suit), resulting in an unnecessary number of operations.
- **Efficiency**: It checks each card twice, once for the rank and again for the suit, even when a card satisfies both conditions early on.
- **Readability**: Although the logic is correct, it might be less intuitive than a cleaner approach.

The alternative solution adheres to these points:

- **Clarity**: It defines a function `can_play_card` that clearly separates concerns: checking for matching ranks and suits within a single loop.
- **Efficiency**: By breaking out of the loop as soon as a match is found, it ensures the operation stops as quickly as possible, improving performance especially with large inputs.
- **Readability**: With a single, clear function call followed by the main logic, the code is cleaner and easier to understand. The `if-else` structure within the function helps in maintaining a logical flow that's easy to follow.
