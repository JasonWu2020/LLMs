Critique:

The provided solution is concise and directly addresses the problem. However, it assumes that the input values are always valid, i.e., both numbers are positive and the first number is less than or equal to the second. 

A more robust solution would include error checking to handle invalid inputs.

Here's a revised solution that includes input validation and uses more descriptive variable names:

```python
def calculate_hipster_socks(a, b):
    if not (isinstance(a, int) and isinstance(b, int) and a > 0 and b > 0):
        raise ValueError("Both inputs must be positive integers")

    red_socks = a
    blue_socks = b
    days_with_different_socks = 0
    days_with_same_socks = 0

    while red_socks > 0 and blue_socks > 0:
        if red_socks > blue_socks:
            red_socks -= 1
            days_with_different_socks += 1
        else:
            blue_socks -= 1
            days_with_different_socks += 1

        if red_socks > 0:
            red_socks -= 1
            days_with_same_socks += 1
        elif blue_socks > 0:
            blue_socks -= 1
            days_with_same_socks += 1

    return days_with_different_socks, days_with_same_socks

a, b = map(int, input().split())
days_with_different_socks, days_with_same_socks = calculate_hipster_socks(a, b)
print(f"{days_with_different_socks} {days_with_same_socks}")
```

This solution uses a while loop to simulate the days, and two variables to keep track of the days with different socks and the days with the same socks. It also includes input validation to ensure that both inputs are positive integers.
