**Critique of the original solution:**

The original solution is concise and readable. However, it has some potential issues:

1. The function `can_play` does not handle the case where the input strings are not in the correct format. It assumes that the input strings are always two characters long and contain only the specified characters. If the input is malformed, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results.
2. The function does not handle the case where the input cards are not unique. The problem statement guarantees that all cards are different, but the function does not check for this.
3. The function uses string slicing and concatenation, which can be slow for large inputs.

**Improved solution:**

```python
```python
def can_play(card_on_table, hand):
    ranks = '23456789TJQKA'
    suits = 'DCSH'
    table_rank = card_on_table[0]
    table_suit = card_on_table[1]
    for card in hand:
        if card[0] == table_rank or card[1] == table_suit:
            return "YES"
    return "NO"

table = input()
hand = [input() for _ in range(5)]
print(can_play(table, hand))
```
