**Critique of the Outputted Solution:**

The outputted solution is concise and easy to read. However, it does not explicitly calculate the minimum number of shovels that can be bought with the given coin denominations. Instead, it directly calculates the maximum number of shovels that can be bought with 10 times the price of a single shovel.

**Alternative Solution:**

```python
import math

k, r = map(int, input().split())

def gcd(a, b):
    while b!= 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

min_shovels = math.ceil(k / gcd(k, r))
print(min_shovels)
```

This solution uses the concept of Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) to find the minimum number of shovels that can be bought. The GCD of `k` and `r` represents the largest amount that can be evenly divided by both `k` and `r`. By dividing `k` by the GCD, we can find the minimum number of shovels that can be bought. The `math.ceil` function is used to round up to the nearest whole number, as we cannot buy a fraction of a shovel.
