Critique of the original solution:

* The solution uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each coin value. This is a good approach, but it doesn't consider the fact that we need to find the minimum number of pockets required to distribute the coins.
* The solution simply prints the number of unique coin values, which is not necessarily the minimum number of pockets required.
* The solution does not consider the possibility of grouping coins of the same value together and distributing them in the same pocket.

Here's an alternative solution that addresses these issues:

```python
```python
def min_pockets(n, a):
    a.sort()
    pockets = 1
    current_value = a[0]
    for x in a[1:]:
        if x!= current_value:
            pockets += 1
            current_value = x
    return pockets

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(min_pockets(n, a))
```
