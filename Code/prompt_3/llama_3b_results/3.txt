**Critique of the outputted solution:**

The provided solution is generally correct, but it has some inefficiencies and potential issues:

1.  **Inefficient algorithm:** The `check` function uses a recursive approach to try all possible placements of the rooks, which can be inefficient for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a backtracking algorithm that tries to place the rooks in a more systematic way.
2.  **No input validation:** The solution does not validate the input values. For example, it assumes that `n` and `k` are integers and that `k` is not greater than `n`. It would be better to add input validation to handle these cases.
3.  **No handling of invalid cases:** The solution does not handle cases where it is impossible to place `k` rooks on an `n x n` board. For example, if `k` is greater than `n`, it should print `-1`.
4.  **Code organization:** The solution mixes the logic for reading input, solving the problem, and printing output. It would be better to separate these concerns into different functions.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
import sys

def read():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

def solve(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return -1
    if k % 2 == 0:
        if k > n:
            return -1
        grid = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(0, n - k + 1, 2):
            for j in range(0, n - k + 1, 2):
                for x in range(k):
                    grid[i + x][j + x] = 'R'
        return '\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])
    else:
        if k > n:
            return -1
        grid = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(0, n - k + 1, 2):
            for j in range(0, n - k + 1, 2):
                for x in range(k):
                    grid[i + x][j] = 'R'
                grid[i][j + k - 1] = 'R'
        return '\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = read()
        print(solve(n, k))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This alternative solution uses a more systematic approach to place the rooks on the board, and it separates the concerns of reading input, solving the problem, and printing output into different functions. It also includes input validation to handle cases where `k` is greater than `n`.
