**Critique of the original solution:**

The original solution is well-structured and readable. However, it has a few areas for improvement:

- The function `sum_of_digits` can be simplified using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
- The variable `n` is used to store the input number, but it's not necessary to reassign it in the loop. The input number can be directly used in the `range` function.
- There's no error handling for the case where the input number is not an integer.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def is_interesting(n):
    return sum_of_digits(n + 1) < sum_of_digits(n)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum(is_interesting(j) for j in range(1, n + 1)))
```
