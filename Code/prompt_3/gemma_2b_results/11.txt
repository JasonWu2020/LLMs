The provided code implements a working solution but lacks user-friendliness for the given constraints, especially when dealing with multiple input lines.

```python
def min_shovels(k, r):
  total_shovels = 0
  coins = 10
  while k > 0:
    coins -= coins**(i)
     if (k%10 == 0) and (coins >= r):
        total_shovels += 1
        k -= 1
        coins = 10
    
  return total_shovels, coins
```



**Critique of the Initial Solution:**

* **Indentation:** The indented code is not well-formatted. Python often requires consistent indentation for readability.
* **Readability:**  The logic isn't clear in the `min_shovels` function.
* **Code Style:**  It would be more readable with proper indentation.


**Improving Efficiency and Readability**


```python
def min_shovels(k, r):
    """Calculates the minimum number of shovels needed for Polycarp to purchase.

    Args:
    k: The price of a shovel in burles.
    r: The denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket.

    Returns:
    The minimum number of shovels needed.
    """
    return  (k // (10 - r)) + 1


if __name__ == '__main__':
    while True:
        k, r = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 0 and r == 0: 
            break
        solution = min_shovels(k, r)
        print(solution)
```



**Improvements:**

* **Function for Clarity:** The code has been wrapped in a function to separate its behavior into clear units. 
* **Code Readability:** The code is more readable for a larger number of input lines with the use of comments for clarity.
* **Readability** Consistent indentation improves readability and makes the code more organized.
