You should use a dictionary to efficiently check for distinct values and avoid repeated calculations. The provided solution has two drawbacks:

1. **Repeated calculations**: It iterates through the list multiple times. 
2. **Inefficient comparison**: It compares each element to the previous element.

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
dp = [1] * len(a)

valid = {}
count = 0 
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] not in valid:
        valid[a[i]] = 0
    valid[a[i]] = count
    if a[i] != a[i-1]:
       dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
        count = 0
```



**Here's a breakdown**
1. **Input Reading and Initialization:** The code reads the number of coins (`n`) and the values of the coins (`a`). 
2. **Sorting:**  The code sorts the coins, creating a foundation for the strategy and the efficient use of dictionaries
3. **Initialization:** `dp`  list starts with all values at 1 as base case 
4. **Looping and Calculation:** The loop efficiently updates `dp[i]` by checking if the current coin `a[i]` is distinct. The code counts the number of valid indices. The loop then updates the `dp` array, using the computed value of `count`.
5. **Minimizing Pointers:**  The code reduces the number of pointers by skipping unnecessary comparisons, as the code only looks at values which are not the same.
