The included solution is correct for the specific input/output format, but uses a naive binary search method. It has to iteratively modify a `max_days` counter in order to find the length of the longest fashion run. It also has to calculate a very large number of days for the end of the fashion run. 

Here's a less naive solution using modular arithmetic to prevent overflowing potential int variable:

```python
def is_valid(n):
  """ Checks if a given number of socks can be a valid fashion run."""

  return n >= 1 and n % 2 == 0 

def max_days(a, b):
  if a == 0 or b == 0:
    return 0
  return (b + a - 1) // (a + b - 1)

def days_same_socks(a, b):
  return (b + a - 1) % (a + b - 1)

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
  a, b = map(int, input().split())
  max_days = max_days(a, b)
  days_same_socks = days_same_socks(a, b)
  print(max_days, days_same_socks)
```
