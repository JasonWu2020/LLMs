```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    result = 0
    for x in range(1, n+1):
        sum_x = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(x))
        sum_x_plus_1 = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(x+1))
        if sum_x_plus_1 < sum_x:
            result += 1
    print(result)
```

This code reads the number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n`. For each number `x`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_x`) and the sum of the digits of `x+1` (`sum_x_plus_1`). If `sum_x_plus_1` is less than `sum_x`, it increments the result counter. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.
