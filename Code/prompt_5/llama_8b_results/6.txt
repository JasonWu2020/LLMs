```python
# Read the card on the table
table_card = input().strip()

# Read the cards in the hand
hand_cards = [input().strip() for _ in range(5)]

# Define the ranks and suits
ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
suits = ['D', 'C', 'S', 'H']

# Check if any card in the hand can be played
can_play = any(
    (table_card[0] == card[0] or table_card[1] == card[1]) 
    for card in hand_cards
)

# Print the result
print("YES" if can_play else "NO")
```

This code works by reading the card on the table and the cards in the hand, then checking if any of the cards in the hand can be played by comparing the rank and suit of each card with the card on the table. The result is then printed to the console.
