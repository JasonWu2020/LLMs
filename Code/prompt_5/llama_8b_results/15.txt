```python
n = int(input())
antons_before = None
antons_after = None
for _ in range(n):
    name, before, after = input().split()
    before = int(before)
    after = int(after)
    if before > after:
        continue
    if antons_before is not None and antons_after is not None:
        if before >= 2400 and before > antons_before and after <= antons_after:
            print("YES")
            exit()
    antons_before = before
    antons_after = after
print("NO")
```

This script reads the number of participants that Anton outscored, then for each of them, it checks if their rating increased. If Anton's rating increased and the person he outscored had a rating of 2400 or higher before the contest and did not increase their rating, it prints "YES". If it finds such a case, it stops execution and prints "YES". If it checks all participants without finding such a case, it prints "NO".
