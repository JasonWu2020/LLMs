```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()

    result = ""
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        result += s[i]
        i += 2
    print(result)
```

This Python script will solve the problem by iterating through the input string `s` and adding every other character to the result string. The `while` loop will continue until it has processed all characters in `s`, effectively skipping over the characters that are added after each character in the original string `a`.
