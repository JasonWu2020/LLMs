            elif i == k and j == 1:
                print("R", end='')
            elif i == k or j == k:
                print("R", end='')
            else:
                print(".", end='')
        print()

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k > n:
            print(-1)

    main()
```

This script will first read the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it will read the size of the board `n` and the number of rooks `k`. If `k` is greater than `n`, it will print `-1`, because it's impossible to place `k` rooks on an `n x n` board in a stable way. Otherwise, it will print a stable arrangement of `k` rooks on the `n x n` board.
