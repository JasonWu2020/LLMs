```python
def min_pockets(n, coins):
    # Create a set to track unique coin values
    unique_coins = set()
    
    # Iterate through each coin's value
    for coin in coins:
        # Add the coin's value to the set if it's not already there
        unique_coins.add(coin)
    
    # The number of unique coin values corresponds to the minimum number of pockets needed
    return len(unique_coins)

# Read input
n = int(input().strip())
coins = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Calculate and print the result
print(min_pockets(n, coins))
```

This script reads the number of coins and their values from standard input, calculates the minimum number of pockets needed based on unique coin values, and prints the result.
