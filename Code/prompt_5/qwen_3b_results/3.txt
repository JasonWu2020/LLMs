test_cases = [tuple(map(int, data[i].split())) for i in range(1, len(data), 2)]

for n, k in test_cases:
    print(find_stable_arrangement(n, k))
```

This script reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case, then attempts to find a stable arrangement of rooks on an `n x n` chessboard. If no such arrangement exists, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the arrangement as specified.
