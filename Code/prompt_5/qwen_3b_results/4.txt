```python
def decrypt_string(s):
    decrypted = []
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if char not in stack:
            # If the character is not in the stack, it means we found a new character in the original string
            decrypted.append(char)
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            # If the character is already in the stack, we add it back to the stack to maintain order
            stack.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(decrypted)

# Number of test cases
T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):
    # Length of the encrypted message
    N = int(input())
    # Encrypted message
    S = input()
    
    # Decrypting the string
    A = decrypt_string(S)
    print(A)
```

This Python script reads multiple test cases, each with an encrypted string, and outputs the decrypted string for each case. The `decrypt_string` function iterates through the encrypted string, adding characters to a stack when they are encountered for the first time, ensuring the decryption process is correct.
