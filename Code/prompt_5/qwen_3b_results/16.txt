```python
def count_interesting_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        if S(x + 1) < S(x):
            count += 1
    return count

def S(x):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(x))

# Read input
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    print(count_interesting_numbers(n))
```

This Python script defines a function `count_interesting_numbers` that calculates how many numbers from 1 to `n` are interesting according to the defined criteria. It also includes a helper function `S` to compute the sum of digits of a number. The script reads the number of test cases and then processes each case by calling `count_interesting_numbers` and printing the result for each test case.
