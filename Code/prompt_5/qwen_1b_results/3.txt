```python
def find_stable_arrangement(n, k):
    # This function returns a valid arrangement of k rooks on an nxn chessboard
    return [
        ['.' if i != j else 'R' for j in range(1, n+1)] 
        for i in range(1, n+1)
    ]

# Read input
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print('\n'.join(find_stable_arrangement(n, k)))
```

This Python script defines a function `find_stable_arrangement` which generates a stable arrangement of k rooks on an nxn chessboard. It then reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard and the number of rooks. Finally, it prints out the stable arrangement using the generated function.
