shortest_password_length(test_cases, passwords)
```

This Python script solves the problem by iterating through the given passwords, identifying pairs that need to be replaced according to the rules, and counting how many operations are needed until no further replacements can be made. It then outputs the shortest possible length of the password after these operations.
