```python
def longest_good_subsequence(s):
    n = len(s)
    k = ord(s[0])
    freq = [0] * (ord('a')+1)
    for i in range(n):
        freq[ord(s[i])-ord('A')] += 1
    
    max_len = 0
    for j in range(ord('A') , ord('z')+1):
        if freq[j-ord('A')] > 0:
            max_len = max(max_len, freq[j-ord('A')])
        else:
            continue
    return max_len

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

print(longest_good_subsequence(s)) 
``` 





This code does the following:

1. **Calculates Frequencies**:
   - Initializes a frequency array, `freq`, to store the count of each uppercase letter. 
   - Iterates through the input string `s`, adding 1 to the corresponding frequency in `freq` for every letter.


2. **Finds the Longest Good Subsequence**: 
   - Iterates through the alphabet (assuming uppercase letters).
   - Checks if the frequency count for each letter in `freq` exists. 
   - Updates the max length if the found frequency count is greater than the previously held maximum
3. **Returns the Result**:
   - Prints the `max_len` that represents the maximum number of occurrences from the original string `s`.

Let me know if you'd like help with a test case to understand how the code works in action! <end_of_turn>
