```python
# This Python script calculates the maximum number of days Vasya the Hipster can wear different colored socks,
# followed by the number of days he can wear the same colored socks. The script takes two inputs: 'a' for red socks,
# and 'b' for blue socks. It outputs two space-separated integers: the first integer is the maximum number of days
# Vasya can wear different socks, and the second integer is the number of days he can wear the same socks.
#
# Example:
# >>> solve_socks(2, 1)
# "1 1"
# >>> solve_socks(4, 3)
# "2 1"

def solve_socks(red_socks, blue_socks):
    # Calculate the number of days Vasya can wear different socks
    different_days = min(red_socks, blue_socks)

    # After wearing different socks, calculate the remaining days for the same socks
    same_days = (max(red_socks, blue_socks) - different_days) // 2

    return f"{different_days} {same_days}"

# Function to check the solution against provided test cases
def check_solution():
    assert solve_socks(2, 1) == "1 1", "Test case 1 failed"
    assert solve_socks(4, 3) == "2 1", "Test case 2 failed"
    assert solve_socks(5, 5) == "5 0", "Test case 3 failed"
    assert solve_socks(6, 7) == "3 2", "Test case 4 failed"
    print("All test cases passed!")

# Uncomment the following line to check the solution
# check_solution()
```

To run the script, simply call `check_solution()` function.
