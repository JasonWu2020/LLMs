Here's the Python solution for your problem:

```python
def determine_training_muscle(n, exercises):
    # Initialize counts for each muscle
    chest_count = 0
    biceps_count = 0
    back_count = 0
    
    for exercise in exercises:
        if exercise == 1:
            if n % 3 == 1:
                chest_count += 1
            elif n % 3 == 2:
                biceps_count += 1
            else:
                back_count += 1
        elif exercise == 2:
            if n % 3 == 1:
                biceps_count += 1
            elif n % 3 == 2:
                back_count += 1
            else:
                chest_count += 1
        else:
            if n % 3 == 1:
                back_count += 1
            elif n % 3 == 2:
                chest_count += 1
            else:
                biceps_count += 1
                
    # Determine which muscle gets the most exercises
    muscles = ['chest', 'biceps', 'back']
    max_count = max(chest_count, biceps_count, back_count)
    
    return muscles[exercise_counts.index(max(exercise_counts))]

# Sample usage
n = int(input())
exercises = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(determine_training_muscle(n, exercises))
```

This code defines a function `determine_training_muscle` that takes the total number of exercises `n` and a list of repetitions `exercises` as inputs. It then determines which muscle gets the most exercises based on the distribution of the different types of exercises in the input list.
