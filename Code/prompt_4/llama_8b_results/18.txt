**Critique of the original solution:**

The original solution is a good start, but it can be improved in a few ways:

1.  The solution assumes that the input arrays are small, and it uses a set to find the common elements. However, for large inputs, this approach may not be efficient. A more efficient approach would be to use a hash map to store the elements of one array and then iterate over the other array to find the common elements.
2.  The solution does not handle the case where the input arrays are empty. It would be good to add a check for this case and output "NO" immediately.
3.  The solution assumes that the input arrays contain only positive integers. It would be good to add a check for this case and handle it accordingly.
4.  The solution does not handle the case where the input arrays contain duplicate elements. It would be good to add a check for this case and handle it accordingly.

**Improved solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if not a or not b:
        print("NO")
    else:
        a_set = set(a)
        b_set = set(b)
        common = list(a_set & b_set)

        if not common:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(len(common))
            print(*sorted(common))
```

However, a more efficient solution would be to use a hash map to store the elements of one array and then iterate over the other array to find the common elements.

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if not a or not b:
        print("NO")
    else:
        a_map = {}
        for x in a:
            if x not in a_map:
                a_map[x] = 1
            else:
                a_map[x] += 1

        common = []
        for x in b:
            if x in a_map and a_map[x] > 0:
                common.append(x)
                a_map[x] -= 1

        if not common:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(len(common))
            print(*sorted(common))
```
