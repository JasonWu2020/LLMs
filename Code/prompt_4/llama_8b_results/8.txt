The outputted solution is generally correct but it can be improved in terms of readability and maintainability. Here's a critique:

1. The solution uses a lot of nested if-else statements, which can make it hard to read and understand.
2. The solution does not handle the case where `a == b == c == 0` separately, which is a valid input case.
3. The solution uses `min` function with integer division, which can be simplified.

Here's an alternative solution that addresses these issues:

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    
    if a + b + c == 0:
        print(0)
    elif a == 0:
        print(b + min(2 * min(c, b // 2), b))
    elif b == 0:
        print(a + min(2 * min(a // 2, c), a))
    elif c == 0:
        print(b + min(2 * min(b // 2, a), b))
    else:
        stones = 0
        while a >= 1 and b >= 2 and c >= 2:
            a -= 1
            b -= 2
            c -= 2
            stones += 5
        while a >= 1 and b >= 1 and c >= 2:
            a -= 1
            b -= 1
            c -= 2
            stones += 3
        while b >= 1 and c >= 2:
            b -= 1
            c -= 2
            stones += 3
        stones += min(a, b) + min(b, c)
        print(stones)
```

This solution uses a more straightforward approach by first handling the special cases where one of `a`, `b`, or `c` is zero. Then it uses a while loop to simulate the stone-collecting process, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
