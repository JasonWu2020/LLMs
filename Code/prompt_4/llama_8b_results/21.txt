The outputted solution is concise and directly addresses the problem. However, it assumes that the input is a list of unique values or has unique values after removing duplicates, which might not always be the case. A more robust solution should handle the case where there are duplicate values.

Here's an alternative solution that uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each value and then returns the maximum count:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
count = {}
for value in a:
    if value in count:
        count[value] += 1
    else:
        count[value] = 1
print(max(count.values()))
```

This solution has the same time and space complexity as the original solution, but it handles the case where there are duplicate values.
