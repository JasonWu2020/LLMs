**Critique of the outputted solution**

The outputted solution is clear and concise, and it directly addresses the problem. However, it can be improved in terms of readability and maintainability. Here are some suggestions:

* The variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `n` could be `num_exercises`, `a` could be `exercise_counts`, `chest` could be `chest_exercises`, `biceps` could be `biceps_exercises`, and `back` could be `back_exercises`.
* The loop could be simplified by using a dictionary to map the exercise types to their corresponding counts.
* The final if-elif-else statement could be simplified by using the `max` function with a dictionary.

**Alternative solution**

```python
n = int(input())
exercise_counts = list(map(int, input().split()))
exercise_types = {'chest': 0, 'biceps': 0, 'back': 0}

for i, count in enumerate(exercise_counts):
    exercise_types[(i % 3) + 1] += count

max_exercise = max(exercise_types, key=exercise_types.get)
print(max_exercise)
```
