The outputted solution has a few issues:

1. It assumes that the remainder of `k % r` will always be a multiple of 10, which is not necessarily true. For example, if `k = 17` and `r = 3`, the remainder is 1, not a multiple of 10.

2. The line `r = (k % r) * 10` is incorrect. It's trying to calculate the remainder of `k` divided by `r`, but it's not doing it correctly.

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
k, r = map(int, input().split())
r = r % 10
if k % r == 0:
    print(1)
else:
    q, m = divmod(k, r)
    print(max(q, m + 1))
```

This solution uses the `divmod` function to correctly calculate the quotient `q` and remainder `m` of `k` divided by `r`. It then prints the maximum of `q` and `m + 1`, which is the minimum number of shovels Polycarp needs to buy.
