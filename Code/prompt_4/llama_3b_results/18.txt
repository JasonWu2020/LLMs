**Critique of the original solution:**

*   The solution uses sets to find the intersection of the two arrays, which is a good approach for this problem. However, it does not handle the case where there are duplicate elements in the arrays.
*   The solution uses two pointers to iterate through the sorted arrays and find the common elements. This approach is efficient and works well for this problem.
*   However, the solution does not handle the case where one of the arrays is empty. In this case, the solution should return the non-empty array as the result.
*   The solution does not handle the case where there is only one common element. In this case, the solution should return the common element as the result.

**Alternative solution:**

```python
```python
import sys

def find_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return "YES\n1\n" + str(min(a + b))
    a_set = set(a)
    b_set = set(b)
    common = a_set & b_set
    if not common:
        return "NO"
    a.sort()
    b.sort()
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            result.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif a[i] < b[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    if i!= len(a) and j!= len(b):
        return "NO"
    if len(result) == 1:
        return "YES\n1\n" + str(result[0])
    return "YES\n" + str(len(result)) + "\n" + " ".join(map(str, result))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_common_subsequence(a, b))
```
