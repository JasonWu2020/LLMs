Critique of the original solution:

* The solution is concise and directly addresses the problem statement.
* It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which is a straightforward approach.
* However, the solution does not handle the case where `b` is zero, which would cause a ZeroDivisionError.
* The solution uses `max(0, b - (a % b))`, which is equivalent to `(b - (a % b))`. This is unnecessary and can be simplified to `(a % b)`. 

Here's an improved solution:

```python
```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print((a + b - 1) // b)
```
