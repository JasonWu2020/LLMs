Critique of the original solution:

The original solution is concise and directly addresses the problem. However, it does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal. In this case, the solution would output `(a, 0)`, which is incorrect.

Here's a revised solution that handles this edge case:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
if a == b:
    print(a, 0)
else:
    print(min(a, b), min((a - 1) // 2, (b - 1) // 2))
```

This solution first checks if `a` and `b` are equal. If they are, it prints `(a, 0)`, which is the correct output. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks as `min(a, b)`, and the maximum number of days when he can wear the same socks as `min((a - 1) // 2, (b - 1) // 2)`. The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure that the result is an integer.
