The provided solution exhibits several potential issues: 

**Critique:**

* **Redundancy:** The code does not do a robust attempt to actually find a stable arrangement as it  does not go far enough in its logic to make use of the problem's requirements. 
* **Incomplete Implementation:**  It reads the input, calls functions but does not implement the algorithm fully to determine if a given arrangement of rooks on the $n \times n$ chessboard is stable.

 **Modified Solution** 

```python
def is_stable(n, board):
  def is_attack_position(x, y):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
      if i != x: 
        if i in board[x][y] and board[i][y] > board[x][y] and (board[i][y] - 1) < (board[x][y] - 1):
          return True
    return False

  def find_stable(x,y):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
      for k in range (1, n+1): 
        if is_attack_position(i , k) and (k == x or k == y):
          i += 1 
          print(i, end=" ")

  t = int(input())


  for _ in range (t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    board = [ [ 0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]  
    for i in range (n):
      for j in range(n):
        board[i][j] = int(input())
    

    print( ' '.join(map(str, board))) 
    stable = find_stable(0,0)
   

```
