The provided solution has several issues:

1. **It requires a bit of refactoring:** It works, but could be tidier and more efficient.
2. **Poor explanation and reasoning:**   The explanations for each line of code are not very thorough and the rationale is not explicitly shown.

Here's a revised solution that addresses these problems:


```python
n = int(input())
s = list(input())
t = list(input())

moves = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] != t[i]:
        moves += 1 

print(moves)
```
