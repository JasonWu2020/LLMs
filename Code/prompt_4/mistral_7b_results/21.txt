[/INST] The outputted solution does not contain any errors but it could be improved by adding some comments for better readability:

```python
# Read the number of coins
n = int(input())

# Read the coins values
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the coins in non-descending order
coins.sort(reverse=True)

# Initialize the number of pockets
pockets = 1

# Initialize the last coin variable
last_coin = coins[0]

# Iterate through the sorted array of coins
for coin in coins[1:]:
    # If the current coin value is different from the value of the last coin added to a pocket
    if coin != last_coin:
        # Increment the number of pockets
        pockets += 1
        # Update the last coin value
        last_coin = coin

# Print the minimum number of pockets needed
print(pockets)
```

This solution follows the same input and output specifications and includes comments for better readability.</s>
