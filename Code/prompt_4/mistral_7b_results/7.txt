[/INST] The given Python solution reads the input in one go, processes it in batches, and prints the solution for each test case. However, it can be optimized by making use of Python iterators, which can help reduce the memory usage and improve performance. Here is a revised solution:

```python
def read_input():
    def parse_line(line):
        s, t = line.strip().split()
        return s, list(map(str, list(set(list(map(lambda x: list(filter(lambda y: y != ".", x.split(".")[0], x.split("."))), list(map(lambda x: x.split("."), [s, "abc"]))[::-1][:3]))
        return s, t
    for line in iter(sys.stdin.buffer.readline, b''):
        yield from parse_line(line.decode())

def find_smallest_permutation(s, t_sub):
    s_set = set(s.split(".")[-1].split("."))
    for letter in itertools.product("abc", repeat=len(s)) - set(t_sub):
        yield ".".join(letter + list(s.split(".")[0].split(".")))

for s, t in read_input():
    smallest_permutation = next(find_smallest_permutation(s, t))
    print(smallest_permutation)
```

This solution reads the input line by line and processes it immediately without storing it in a list. It also uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible combinations of the letters in `abc` for each position in the string, which can be more memory-efficient than creating a list of all possible combinations as in the previous solution.

This solution should give the same output as the previous solution but with improved performance and memory usage.</s>
