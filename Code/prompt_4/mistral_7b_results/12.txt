[/INST] The outputted solution appears to be valid as it follows the input and output specifications provided in the problem statement. However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made to the code:

1. The function `is_subsequence_balanced` is redundant as the substring is balanced if and only if the number of 'a' and 'b' letters are equal.
2. The function `is_balanced` could be simplified by using two pointers instead of using a while loop to move the left pointer.
3. The function `is_balanced` could be renamed to something more descriptive.
4. The input could be validated to ensure it meets the problem specifications.
5. The code could be formatted for readability.

Here's an alternative solution:

```python
def is_balanced(s):
    a_count, b_count = 0, 0
    left, right = 0, 0
    while right < len(s):
        right += 1
        if s[right] == 'a':
            a_count += 1
        else:
            b_count += 1
        if a_count == b_count:
            return (left+1, right)
    return (-1, -1)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if n < 1 or n > 50:
        print(-1, -1)
        continue
    s = input()
    if len(s) != n:
        print(-1, -1)
        continue
    print(is_balanced(s)[0], is_balanced(s)[1])
```</s>
