**Critique:**

The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case reads the values of n and k, the length of the array and the number of operations, and then reads the initial contents of the array. It then calculates the maximum value d from the array, calculates the final value for each element in the array as d - a_i, and prints the final array.

**Improved solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    d = max(a)
    a_final = [d - x for x in a]
    print(*a_final)

    a_sum = sum(a_final)
    print(a_sum)
```

This solution includes an additional line to calculate the sum of the final array.<eos>
