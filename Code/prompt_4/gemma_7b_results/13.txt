**Critique:**

The solution is correct, but it can be improved.

**Critique:**

* **Time complexity:** The code calculates the set of unique elements in the array, which has a time complexity of O(n). The array size is at most 2e5, so the time complexity of the code is O(n) as well.
* **Space complexity:** The code calculates the set of unique elements in the array, which has a space complexity of O(n).

**Improved solution:**

```python
t = int(input("Number of test cases: "))

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input("Length of password: "))
    a = list(map(int, input("Enter password: ").split()))
    print(len(set(a)) - 1)
```

**This solution:**

* Uses a set to store the unique elements in the array, which has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n).
* Avoids the need to calculate the set of unique elements in the array separately.<eos>
