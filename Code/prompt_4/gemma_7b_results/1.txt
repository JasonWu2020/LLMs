## Critique

The code is well-structured and efficient. It uses an adjacency list `adj` to represent the relationships between friends and their best friends. The code iterates over the adjacency list to count the number of best friends for each friend and updates the `min_inv` variable if necessary.

**Improvements:**

* **Use a dictionary `visited` to prevent repeated counting of best friends:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    adj = {i: set() for i in range(n)}
    visited = {i: False for i in range(n)}
    for i in range(n):
        adj[p[i]].add(i)

    min_inv = 0
    for friend, best_friends in adj.items():
        if not visited[friend] and len(best_friends) > min_inv:
            min_inv = len(best_friends)
            visited[friend] = True

    print(min_inv)
```

* **Use a set `best_friends` to store the best friends of each friend:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    adj = {i: set() for i in range(n)}
    best_friends = {i: set() for i in range(n)}
    for i in range(n):
        adj[p[i]].add(i)
        best_friends[i].add(p[i])

    min_inv = 0
    for friend in best_friends:
        if len(best_friends[friend]) > min_inv:
            min_inv = len(best_friends[friend])

    print(min_inv)
```

These improvements would make the code more efficient and prevent repeated calculations.

**Note:** The code assumes that the input is valid and meets the specified constraints.<eos>
