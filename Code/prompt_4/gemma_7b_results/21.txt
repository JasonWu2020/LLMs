<start_of_turn>model
**Critique:**

The solution is simple and efficient. It sorts the coins based on their values and then iterates over them, grouping coins with the same value into the same pocket. The only optimization is to use a variable `current_value` to store the value of the previous coin, so that you don't have to compare the value of the current coin with the value of the previous coin in the loop.

**Improved Solution:**

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
pockets = 1
current_value = a[0]
groups = {}
for i in range(len(a)):
    group_key = str(a[i])
    if group_key not in groups:
        groups[group_key] = 1
    else:
        groups[group_key] += 1
pockets = sum(groups.values())
print(pockets)
```<eos>
