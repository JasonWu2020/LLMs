**Critique:**

The solution is concise and efficient, but it does not handle the case where Vasya has no socks of either color. In this case, the output should be 0 for both the number of days he can wear different socks and the number of days he can wear the same socks.

**Corrected Solution:**

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a + b == 0:
    print(0, 0)
else:
    print(min(a, b), max(a, b) - min(a, b))
```<eos>
