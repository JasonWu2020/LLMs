**Critique:**

The solution provided above is concise and efficient, but it can be improved. The code calculates the frequency of each letter twice, once in the `freq` dictionary and once in the `min_freq` dictionary. This can be optimized by calculating the frequency of each letter only once and storing it in the `min_freq` dictionary directly.

**Optimized Solution:**

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input().upper()

freq = {}
for letter in s:
    if letter not in freq:
        freq[letter] = 0
    freq[letter] += 1

min_freq = {}
for letter in range(k):
    min_freq[letter] = freq[letter]

length = sum(min_freq.values())

print(length)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).<eos>
