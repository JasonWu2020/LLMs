**Critique:**

The solution reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads the integer $n$, calculates the sum of digits of $n$, and the sum of digits of $n + 1, and checks if the sum of digits of $n + 1 is less than the sum of digits of $n$. If it is, it prints 1, otherwise prints 0.

**Improvements:**

- The code can be improved by using a function to calculate the sum of digits to reduce code duplication.
- The code can also be improved by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the sum of digits.

**Corrected Solution:**

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    def sum_of_digits(x):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(x).split())
    print(sum_of_digits(n) - sum_of_digits(n + 1) <= 9)
```<eos>
