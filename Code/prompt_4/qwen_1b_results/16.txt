```python
def count_interesting_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i)) > sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i+1)):
            count += 1
    return count

# Read input from stdin
t = int(input())

# Iterate through each test case
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    # Print the result for the current test case
    print(count_interesting_numbers(n))
```

This Python script correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n`, checks if the sum of their digits increases when incremented by 1 (`S(x + 1) < S(x)`), and counts how many such numbers exist within the specified range. The script handles multiple test cases efficiently by using a loop to process each input pair `(n, t)`.
