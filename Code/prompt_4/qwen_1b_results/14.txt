Solution:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

def process_cases(test_cases: int):
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize d with the maximum element in the array
        d = max(a)
        
        # Perform k operations
        while k > 0:
            # Find the index of the maximum element
            i = a.index(d)
            
            # Replace the current element with its complement relative to d
            a[i] = -a[i]
            
            # Update d to the new maximum element
            d = max(d, -a[i])
            
            # Decrease k by 1
            k -= 1
        
        # Print the final array
        print(" ".join(map(str, a)))

# Read the number of test cases from stdin
test_cases = int(input())

# Process each test case
process_cases(test_cases)
```

This Python script reads the number of test cases from standard input, processes each case, and prints the resulting array after performing `k` operations on it. It handles arrays up to size \(2 \times 10^5\) efficiently using the provided constraints.
