Sure! Let's break down how we might approach solving this problem:

### Critique of Provided Solution

The provided Python script reads `t` test cases from standard input, processes each test case, calculates the minimum number of steps required for `a` to become divisible by `b`, and prints the result. However, it does not handle edge cases like when `a` is already divisible by `b`. Additionally, it doesn't check if `a` could potentially never become divisible by `b` (e.g., when `a` is larger than `b`). 

### Improved Solution

Here's an improved version of the solution that includes error handling for these edge cases:

```python
def min_steps_to_divisible(a, b):
    # Check if a is already divisible by b
    if a % b == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the remainder when a is divided by b
    remainder = a % b
    
    # If remainder is greater than half of b, subtract b twice to reach divisibility
    if remainder > b // 2:
        return 2 * b - remainder
    
    # Otherwise, calculate the minimum steps needed
    else:
        return b - remainder

# Read input
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Print the result
    print(min_steps_to_divisible(a, b))
```

This solution checks if `a` is already divisible by `b`. If so, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the remainder and determines whether to subtract `b` once or twice based on whether the remainder is greater than `b // 2`.

### Explanation

- **Edge Case Handling**: The script checks if `a` is divisible by `b` at the beginning. If it is, no further steps are necessary.
- **Subtraction Logic**: For other cases, it calculates the remainder and adjusts accordingly. Subtracting `b` twice ensures that `a` becomes divisible by `b`.
- **Efficiency**: This method efficiently handles large values of `a` and `b` within the constraints.
