**Solution 1:**  
```python
def min_shovels(k, r):
    return k // r + 1 if k % r == 0 else k // r

# Read input
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the result
print(min_shovels(k, r))
```

**Critique on Solution 1:**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - Constant time complexity because the operations inside the function are simple arithmetic calculations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant space usage due to the use of constant variables.
- **Readability**: The code is easy to understand with clear variable names.

**Solution 2:**  
```python
from math import ceil

def min_shovels(k, r):
    return ceil(k / r)

# Read input
k, r = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the result
print(min_shovels(k, r))
```

**Critique on Solution 2:**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(max(k, r))) - Logarithmic time complexity due to the division operation in Python's `ceil` function which uses binary search internally.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant space usage similar to Solution 1.
- **Readability**: The code is concise but slightly less readable compared to Solution 1 due to the use of the built-in `math.ceil` function.
