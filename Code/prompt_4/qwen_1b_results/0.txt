### Solution 1:
```python
from collections import Counter

def find_longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s):
    freq = [Counter() for _ in range(k)]
    
    # Count frequencies of each character up to k-th letter
    for char in s[:min(len(s), k)]:
        freq[ord(char) - ord('A')][char] += 1
    
    max_length = 0
    
    # Check all substrings starting with characters up to k-th letter
    for i in range(min(len(s), k)):
        current_freq = Counter()
        for j in range(i, min(len(s), k)):
            if freq[j].keys() == set(['A']):
                break
            current_freq |= freq[j]
        
        max_length = max(max_length, len(current_freq))
    
    return max_length

# Example usage
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
print(find_longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s))
```

### Critique of Solution 1:
This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization (`Counter` objects) to count the occurrences of each character at different positions within the substring. It iterates through the string `s`, updating the counts of characters and checking for "good" subsequences based on the presence of each character's occurrence. The time complexity is manageable due to the use of memoization.

### Solution 2:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s):
    # Generate all possible subsequences of length n
    subsequences = [''.join(subseq) for i in range(1, n + 1) for subseq in combinations(s, i)]

    max_length = 0
    for seq in subsequences:
        freq = Counter(seq)
        valid = True
        
        # Check if the frequency of each character matches
        for char in freq.keys():
            if freq[char] != freq['A']:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if valid:
            max_length = max(max_length, len(seq))

    return max_length

# Example usage
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
print(find_longest_good_subsequence(n, k, s))
```

### Critique of Solution 2:
Solution 2 leverages combinatorial generation to create all possible subsequences of the given string `s`. It then checks each subsequence against the criteria for being a "good" subsequence using the `Counter` object. This approach avoids explicit counting and reduces redundant work by generating and validating subsequences in bulk. The combination generation ensures all possibilities are considered efficiently.
