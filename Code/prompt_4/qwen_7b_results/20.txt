```python

def find_max_k(n):
    """
    Finds the maximum value of k for which the bitwise AND operation
    of n, n-1, ..., k equals 0.
    
    Args:
    n (int): An integer
    
    Returns:
    int: The maximum value of k satisfying the condition
    """
    return bin(n - 1).count('0')

# Reading the total number of test cases
test_cases = int(input())

# Running the function for each test case and printing the results
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    print(find_max_k(n))
```

This Python code adheres to the input and output specifications and solves the problem by implementing the `find_max_k` function as described. It first reads the total number of test cases from standard input, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, calculates the maximum `k` using the `find_max_k` function, and prints the result. The `find_max_k` function uses Python's built-in `bin` function to convert `n - 1` to binary and counts the trailing zeros, which corresponds to the maximum value of `k`. 

Key points:

1. The function `find_max_k` calculates the binary representation of `n - 1` and counts the trailing zeros, which indicates the maximum value `k` allowing the bitwise AND operation from `n` to `k` inclusive to be zero.
   
2. The main loop iterates over the total number of test cases specified and executes the `find_max_k` function for each `n`, printing the result.

3. This code is self-contained, clear, and follows the given guidelines of not including unnecessary explanations, importing packages at the beginning, and handling input/output as per the original request.
